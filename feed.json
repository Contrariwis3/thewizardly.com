If it autopays, it’s fixed.\r\n\r\n### God saw all that he had made, and it was very good\r\nI’ve spent a lot of words on what I’m planning to do, but not what I’m trying to achieve by doing it. I think because that part’s clear to me but somewhat harder to capture in words.\r\n\r\nOne reason is to fight back against lifestyle inflation. It’s so easy to spend money that I have on things that do not, ultimately, serve my long-term goals. And, once spent, it’s frequently hard to unspend. Sometimes in ways that accrue over time, such as additional subscriptions.\r\n\r\nAnother reason is to avoid developing sophistication that diminishes my enjoyment. If we “can’t afford” the fancier soap, are we really any worse off? What about those nicer bed sheets? That name-brand food product?\r\n\r\nEventually I’d like to reintroduce a significant gap between what I earn and my lifestyle, such that if my material circumstances changed I would not be worse off. This feels like, amongst many other things, good future-proofing.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the day $2500 per month is actually quite a lot for pure discretionary spending. People I respect immensely fit their entire life into that or not much more. It feels like a realistic and worthwhile goal, even as I acknowledge the ways in which I’m on “easy mode” in comparison.\n",

				"title": "A Personal Interest Rubric",
				"content_html": "<p>Have you ever lost something and then spent the next ten years trying to find it?</p>\n<p>I have. It’s an essay about the fall of the Roman Empire. Did the average citizen know the empire had fallen?</p>\n<p>No. It took them about 200 years to figure out, but you’re just going to have to trust me because all the kings horses and all the king’s men haven’t been able to find that paper again.</p>\n<h2>All of this is backstory</h2>\n<p>Back in 2020 I got way into the idea of Personal Knowledge Management (PKM) and went about setting up my first “<a href=\"https://thesweetsetup.com/the-pkm-stack/\">PKM Stack</a>,” or set of tools for solving the problem: how do I stop losing all the interesting things I read.</p>\n<p>The first version of this stack used <a href=\"https://www.instapaper.com/\">Instapaper</a> as my read-it-later, IFTTT, Dropbox, and Obsidian. The workflow sucked. But the basic idea was I’d read something, if it had any highlights those would get put in a markdown file in Dropbox by IFTTT, and then I’d manually drag it over to Obsidian eventually.</p>\n<p>When AI first started taking off Instapaper used it as an opportunity to raise their rates, and not having been CRAZY happy with that solution, and not seeing any value in the then-state of AI, I used it as a chance to rethink, and ended up hopping to <a href=\"https://readwise.io/read\">Readwise Reader</a>.</p>\n<h2>Instapaper to Reader</h2>\n<p>When I migrated from Instapaper to Reader it was, by necessity, an imperfect migration. Instapaper’s output format included a link to the original document, the parts I had highlighted, but not the document text. Reader had to go out and fetch the document bodies again, and in a handful of cases failed. Either because Reader couldn’t parse it, or because the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Link_rot\">document was gone</a>.</p>\n<p>I also had the habit of archiving everything in the hope I would be able to find it later if I needed. This comes from deep trauma: I’m <strong>still</strong> looking for a paper I read a decade ago about whether the average imperial citizen knew the Roman Empire had fallen.</p>\n<p>The result is a large backlog of low-value things that I had read, and saved in case, that I was unlikely to ever look at again. Or find any value in if I did.</p>\n<h2>Reader to the Future</h2>\n<p>Reader is fine for, well, reading, but it’s got usability gaps for making notes and long-term storage. Especially since my primary modality for using it is on an iPad mini on a flight somewhere. Most of my life runs out of Obsidian, why not this?</p>\n<p>After thinking about it I decided that I want every document that I “archive” in Reader to go through an enrichment pipeline that summarizes it, extracts any highlights, extracts any key ideas or topics, and puts a markdown file in the right part of my Obsidian vault with all that information and a link back to the Reader copy, so that I can reference it if needed.</p>\n<p>To make it maximally useful, I needed to do this for everything in the archive, and to do that I needed to get rid of all the low-value documents hanging around in there.</p>\n<h2>How to Build A Rubric And Learn to Love the Atomic Bomb</h2>\n<p>Going through the entire archive was going to require a system that could look at everything and reliably decide what I should or shouldn’t keep. To do that, I needed to be able to describe what I would want to keep. I needed an interest rubric.</p>\n<p>Have you ever tried to describe yourself? Like really describe yourself? Maybe this is easier for other people but man I struggled. I came up with I think about four core interests, but I knew that wasn’t accurate.</p>\n<p>My next attempt was to open a conversation with Claude, explain to it what I was trying to do, and ask it to interview me. This was... Medium successful? It ended up being a much better place to start from but was not in and of itself nearly comprehensive. Again it continued to rely on the things I could think of to prompt it with.</p>\n<p>Finally I thought, okay. Well. I’ve got this backlog of things I’ve read. I know it’s got some stuff I want to get rid of, but it’s also filled with lots of stuff I’d want to keep. Can I use that as the basis for a rubric?</p>\n<p>Bingo.</p>\n<p>The next problem was purely technical. Over 700 documents, many running into the tens of thousands of words. There was going to be no way to put them all into Claude’s context at once. I thought about it and figured “good enough” might be “good enough” at scale: I had Claude write a series of Python scripts that would randomly sample about half of the documents and post them to an OpenAI batch job with the goal of summarizing and extracting key insights.</p>\n<p>I’m not certain if this was the absolute final version of the prompt, but it looked a lot like this:</p>\n<blockquote>Your task is to analyze this document and create a comprehensive summary that would allow someone to understand its core value without reading the full text.\n<p>Document Title: {doc[&lsquo;title&rsquo;]}\nAuthor: {doc.get(&lsquo;author&rsquo;, &lsquo;Unknown&rsquo;)}\nURL: {doc.get(&lsquo;url&rsquo;, &lsquo;Not provided&rsquo;)}</p>\n<p>Content:\n{doc[&lsquo;extracted_content&rsquo;][:15000]}  # Truncate very long content</p>\n<p>Please provide:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>A concise but information-dense summary (2-3 paragraphs) that captures the key ideas, arguments, and context of the document.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>3-5 key insights or takeaways from the document that represent its most valuable content.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>A brief assessment of why this content might be valuable to someone with interests in rationality, economics, science fiction, fantasy, and tabletop role-playing games. If the content seems unrelated to these areas, explain what type of person might find it valuable instead.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Format your response as structured JSON with the following keys:\n&ldquo;summary&rdquo;, &ldquo;key_insights&rdquo; (as an array), and &ldquo;value_assessment&rdquo;.</blockquote></p>\n<p>I think of “summarize a bunch of text” as something Large Language Models (LLMs, such as Claude or ChatGPT) are good at. Perfect use case.</p>\n<p>My next step was to take the first Markdown file and the basis of my rubric from the interviews, and attach them to a conversation with Claude Sonnet 3.7 with Extended Thinking. I typed out like four paragraphs of stream-of-consciousness about what I was trying to do and asked it, in so many words: “based on all these summaries, what interests do you think I have that you don’t see on the rubric?”</p>\n<p>Thus began a long dialogue. It would propose, based on what it saw, what it thought I liked. I would correct, confirm, cajole, and provide insight. Why yes, I am deeply interested in Philosophy. Actually no I’m not that interested in international finance, that one article happened to be really interesting.</p>\n<p>Claude:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Governance and Legal Systems: Your reading suggests deep interest in specific governance mechanisms and legal frameworks beyond general institutional analysis. How central is this comparative approach to governance in your thinking?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Me:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I think I'm interested in how the world works, and how it could be made to work better. How do we build a better world, or at least minimize the chances of a worse world. I don't think I'm specifically interested in governance and legal systems outside of that context.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Claude:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>There's a recurring pattern of interest in Philosophical Frameworks for analyzing complex issues. Would you consider this a hidden interest, or do you see it as simply an aspect of Rationality?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Me:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I am definitely interested in philosophy and philosophical frameworks. If I didn't need to \"work for a living,\" I would strongly consider going back to school for a PhD in Philosophy. I think all of life's interesting questions are in the world of philosophy, and that it's a shame there's no way to make money doing it.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>At the end, I’d ask it to spit out an updated version of the rubric, which I would take to a new conversation with Claude, the next markdown file, and repeat the process. After the second round I asked it to provide me with a prompt that captured everything I was trying to do, which I used for all subsequent iterations of the conversation.</p>\n<p>The output of all these rounds was a several-kilobyte markdown file which accurately captures some, but not all, of my various interests. Not all my interests are captured in the things I read, and a random sampling was always bound to miss something. Nevertheless it’s good for what it got!</p>\n<p>If you think it’d be interesting to see the final result (either to see what we built, or to get a better sense of who I am as a person,) I’ll attach a lightly edited version at the end.</p>\n<h2>Actually Doing the Thing, for Exceptionally Large Values of Thing</h2>\n<p>Originally I was going to take my rubric and repurpose those scripts to have ChatGPT do the review, but I ran into a technical issue and had to pivot to Anthropic for this part. The ChatGPT batch API is convinced that I have batches in progress, even when I don’t and I can’t submit any more.</p>\n<p>Anthropic ended up working out well because their API will let you set a “system” prompt that is distinct from the “user” prompt. The entire rubric and guidance on the return format went into the system prompt, and the user prompt ended up being the document data.</p>\n<p>The first run, everything scored too high. Every document was a keeper, even ones I knew I didn’t want to keep.</p>\n<p>I adjusted the rubric slightly, and it got a little better.</p>\n<p>Finally, I added a point deduction metric for certain topics I knew I didn’t like, and that hit the sweet spot. The final run resulted in a markdown file reviewing everything in my Reader backlog that didn’t have highlights, and suggested around 83 deletions.</p>\n<p>I manually reviewed all suggested deletions, and agreed with all but one of them, which revealed an obvious gap in the rubric. Success! The “keeps” were lightly spot-checked. I don’t need it to be absolutely right about them, because the worst case there is that a future step of this project costs me a little extra money by doing enrichment on a document that has nothing of value to give. I’m not that worried about it.</p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>So what I did I learn? I learned a lot about how batch jobs to OpenAI and Anthropic work. I learned a medium amount about my own interests. I feel like if I had any need to do it I could write an extremely good dating profile now. “Enjoys long walks in the forest and applied epistemology.” I learned a bit more about how to wrangle the best results out of the current state of LLMs.</p>\n<p>My next steps are to take everything I learned and built and begin working on the enrichment pipeline, which I think will look pretty similar in a lot of ways to start. Because I first need to deal with my archive, batch jobs are the most cost effective option. Eventually I’m imagining an AWS Step Function. All of which is better than Ghostreader. Most of which is better than nothing.</p>\n<p>Did this help me find my Roman Empire? Well, no. As far as I can tell that’s well and truly gone. But I think it’s improving the process by which I never let the Empire fall again.</p>\n<hr>\n<h1>Personal Interest Rubric</h1>\n<h2>About the Reader</h2>\n<p>This rubric is designed for a person with

				"content_text": "<p>Have you ever lost something and then spent the next ten years trying to find it?</p>\n\n<p>I have. It’s an essay about the fall of the Roman Empire. Did the average citizen know the empire had fallen?</p>\n\n<p>No. It took them about 200 years to figure out, but you’re just going to have to trust me because all the kings horses and all the king’s men haven’t been able to find that paper again.</p>\n\n<h2>All of this is backstory</h2>\n\n<p>Back in 2020 I got way into the idea of Personal Knowledge Management (PKM) and went about setting up my first “<a href=\"https://thesweetsetup.com/the-pkm-stack/\">PKM Stack</a>,” or set of tools for solving the problem: how do I stop losing all the interesting things I read.</p>\n\n<p>The first version of this stack used <a href=\"https://www.instapaper.com/\">Instapaper</a> as my read-it-later, IFTTT, Dropbox, and Obsidian. The workflow sucked. But the basic idea was I’d read something, if it had any highlights those would get put in a markdown file in Dropbox by IFTTT, and then I’d manually drag it over to Obsidian eventually.</p>\n\n<p>When AI first started taking off Instapaper used it as an opportunity to raise their rates, and not having been CRAZY happy with that solution, and not seeing any value in the then-state of AI, I used it as a chance to rethink, and ended up hopping to <a href=\"https://readwise.io/read\">Readwise Reader</a>.</p>\n\n<h2>Instapaper to Reader</h2>\n\n<p>When I migrated from Instapaper to Reader it was, by necessity, an imperfect migration. Instapaper’s output format included a link to the original document, the parts I had highlighted, but not the document text. Reader had to go out and fetch the document bodies again, and in a handful of cases failed. Either because Reader couldn’t parse it, or because the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Link_rot\">document was gone</a>.</p>\n\n<p>I also had the habit of archiving everything in the hope I would be able to find it later if I needed. This comes from deep trauma: I’m <strong>still</strong> looking for a paper I read a decade ago about whether the average imperial citizen knew the Roman Empire had fallen.</p>\n\n<p>The result is a large backlog of low-value things that I had read, and saved in case, that I was unlikely to ever look at again. Or find any value in if I did.</p>\n\n<h2>Reader to the Future</h2>\n\n<p>Reader is fine for, well, reading, but it’s got usability gaps for making notes and long-term storage. Especially since my primary modality for using it is on an iPad mini on a flight somewhere. Most of my life runs out of Obsidian, why not this?</p>\n\n<p>After thinking about it I decided that I want every document that I “archive” in Reader to go through an enrichment pipeline that summarizes it, extracts any highlights, extracts any key ideas or topics, and puts a markdown file in the right part of my Obsidian vault with all that information and a link back to the Reader copy, so that I can reference it if needed.</p>\n\n<p>To make it maximally useful, I needed to do this for everything in the archive, and to do that I needed to get rid of all the low-value documents hanging around in there.</p>\n\n<h2>How to Build A Rubric And Learn to Love the Atomic Bomb</h2>\n\n<p>Going through the entire archive was going to require a system that could look at everything and reliably decide what I should or shouldn’t keep. To do that, I needed to be able to describe what I would want to keep. I needed an interest rubric.</p>\n\n<p>Have you ever tried to describe yourself? Like really describe yourself? Maybe this is easier for other people but man I struggled. I came up with I think about four core interests, but I knew that wasn’t accurate.</p>\n\n<p>My next attempt was to open a conversation with Claude, explain to it what I was trying to do, and ask it to interview me. This was... Medium successful? It ended up being a much better place to start from but was not in and of itself nearly comprehensive. Again it continued to rely on the things I could think of to prompt it with.</p>\n\n<p>Finally I thought, okay. Well. I’ve got this backlog of things I’ve read. I know it’s got some stuff I want to get rid of, but it’s also filled with lots of stuff I’d want to keep. Can I use that as the basis for a rubric?</p>\n\n<p>Bingo.</p>\n\n<p>The next problem was purely technical. Over 700 documents, many running into the tens of thousands of words. There was going to be no way to put them all into Claude’s context at once. I thought about it and figured “good enough” might be “good enough” at scale: I had Claude write a series of Python scripts that would randomly sample about half of the documents and post them to an OpenAI batch job with the goal of summarizing and extracting key insights.</p>\n\n<p>I’m not certain if this was the absolute final version of the prompt, but it looked a lot like this:</p>\n\n<blockquote>Your task is to analyze this document and create a comprehensive summary that would allow someone to understand its core value without reading the full text.\n\nDocument Title: {doc['title']}\nAuthor: {doc.get('author', 'Unknown')}\nURL: {doc.get('url', 'Not provided')}\n\nContent:\n{doc['extracted_content'][:15000]}  # Truncate very long content\n\nPlease provide:\n\n1. A concise but information-dense summary (2-3 paragraphs) that captures the key ideas, arguments, and context of the document.\n\n2. 3-5 key insights or takeaways from the document that represent its most valuable content.\n\n3. A brief assessment of why this content might be valuable to someone with interests in rationality, economics, science fiction, fantasy, and tabletop role-playing games. If the content seems unrelated to these areas, explain what type of person might find it valuable instead.\n\nFormat your response as structured JSON with the following keys:\n\"summary\", \"key_insights\" (as an array), and \"value_assessment\".</blockquote>\n\n<p>I think of “summarize a bunch of text” as something Large Language Models (LLMs, such as Claude or ChatGPT) are good at. Perfect use case.</p>\n\n<p>My next step was to take the first Markdown file and the basis of my rubric from the interviews, and attach them to a conversation with Claude Sonnet 3.7 with Extended Thinking. I typed out like four paragraphs of stream-of-consciousness about what I was trying to do and asked it, in so many words: “based on all these summaries, what interests do you think I have that you don’t see on the rubric?”</p>\n\n<p>Thus began a long dialogue. It would propose, based on what it saw, what it thought I liked. I would correct, confirm, cajole, and provide insight. Why yes, I am deeply interested in Philosophy. Actually no I’m not that interested in international finance, that one article happened to be really interesting.</p>\n\n<p>Claude:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Governance and Legal Systems: Your reading suggests deep interest in specific governance mechanisms and legal frameworks beyond general institutional analysis. How central is this comparative approach to governance in your thinking?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Me:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>I think I'm interested in how the world works, and how it could be made to work better. How do we build a better world, or at least minimize the chances of a worse world. I don't think I'm specifically interested in governance and legal systems outside of that context.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Claude:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>There's a recurring pattern of interest in Philosophical Frameworks for analyzing complex issues. Would you consider this a hidden interest, or do you see it as simply an aspect of Rationality?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Me:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>I am definitely interested in philosophy and philosophical frameworks. If I didn't need to \"work for a living,\" I would strongly consider going back to school for a PhD in Philosophy. I think all of life's interesting questions are in the world of philosophy, and that it's a shame there's no way to make money doing it.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>At the end, I’d ask it to spit out an updated version of the rubric, which I would take to a new conversation with Claude, the next markdown file, and repeat the process. After the second round I asked it to provide me with a prompt that captured everything I was trying to do, which I used for all subsequent iterations of the conversation.</p>\n\n<p>The output of all these rounds was a several-kilobyte markdown file which accurately captures some, but not all, of my various interests. Not all my interests are captured in the things I read, and a random sampling was always bound to miss something. Nevertheless it’s good for what it got!</p>\n\n<p>If you think it’d be interesting to see the final result (either to see what we built, or to get a better sense of who I am as a person,) I’ll attach a lightly edited version at the end.</p>\n\n<h2>Actually Doing the Thing, for Exceptionally Large Values of Thing</h2>\n\n<p>Originally I was going to take my rubric and repurpose those scripts to have ChatGPT do the review, but I ran into a technical issue and had to pivot to Anthropic for this part. The ChatGPT batch API is convinced that I have batches in progress, even when I don’t and I can’t submit any more.</p>\n\n<p>Anthropic ended up working out well because their API will let you set a “system” prompt that is distinct from the “user” prompt. The entire rubric and guidance on the return format went into the system prompt, and the user prompt ended up being the document data.</p>\n\n<p>The first run, everything scored too high. Every document was a keeper, even ones I knew I didn’t want to keep.</p>\n\n<p>I adjusted the rubric slightly, and it got a little better.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, I added a point deduction metric for certain topics I knew I didn’t like, and that hit the sweet spot. The final run resulted in a markdown file reviewing everything in my Reader backlog that didn’t have highlights, and suggested around 83 deletions.</p>\n\n<p>I manually reviewed all suggested deletions, and agreed with all but one of them, which revealed an obvious gap in the rubric. Success! The “keeps” were lightly spot-checked. I don’t need it to be absolutely right about them, because the worst case there is that a future step of this project costs me a little extra money by doing enrichment on a document that has nothing of value to give. I’m not that worried about it.</p>\n\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n\n<p>So what I did I learn? I learned a lot about how batch jobs to OpenAI and Anthropic work. I learned a medium amount about my own interests. I feel like if I had any need to do it I could write an extremely good dating profile now. “Enjoys long walks in the forest and applied epistemology.” I learned a bit more about how to wrangle the best results out of the current state of LLMs.</p>\n\n<p>My next steps are to take everything I learned and built and begin working on the enrichment pipeline, which I think will look pretty similar in a lot of ways to start. Because I first need to deal with my archive, batch jobs are the most cost effective option. Eventually I’m imagining an AWS Step Function. All of which is better than Ghostreader. Most of which is better than nothing.</p>\n\n<p>Did this help me find my Roman Empire? Well, no. As far as I can tell that’s well and truly gone. But I think it’s improving the process by which I never let the Empire fall again.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h1>Personal Interest Rubric</h1>\n\n<h2>About the Reader</h2>\n\n<p>This rubric is designed for a

patterns</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Scoring Methodology</h2>\n\n<p>This rubric uses a point-based system with both positive criteria and penalties:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>\n<strong>Calculate Positive Points</strong>: First, add all points from the Core Criteria (0-70 possible) and Bonus Criteria (0-30 possible) sections based on the document's strengths.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Apply Penalties</strong>: Next, subtract any applicable penalty points from the Topics to Avoid (-75 points per topic) or Content to Approach with Caution (-15 to -25 points per category) sections.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Determine Final Score</strong>: The resulting total represents the document's final score, which should be evaluated against the Final Score Interpretation scale.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Decision Rule</strong>: Documents scoring below 50 points after all calculations should be discarded, regardless of their initial positive score.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h2>Final Score Interpretation</h2>\n\n<ul>\n<li>90‑100: Exceptionally interesting – drop everything to read and deeply engage</li>\n<li>75‑89: Highly interesting – worth dedicated time and attention</li>\n<li>60‑74: Quite interesting – worth reading completely</li>\n<li>50‑59: Moderately interesting – skim for valuable sections</li>\n<li><strong>Discard threshold (below 50 points)</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Topics to Track</h2>\n\n<p>This section captures nascent topics that have appeared in my reading but haven't yet accumulated enough evidence to warrant promotion to core interests. Items here have typically appeared in 1-2 documents that resonated with me but don't yet demonstrate consistent engagement across multiple sources.</p>\n\n<p>I track these topics to identify patterns in my evolving interests. When I notice multiple high-quality pieces related to the same tracked topic over time, this signals a potential new core interest emerging. This approach helps me recognize genuine shifts in my intellectual focus rather than temporary curiosities.</p>\n\n<p>Each topic below represents a potential direction for future exploration that has shown some initial promise. They remain in this \"waiting room\" until sufficient evidence accumulates to justify promotion to a core interest.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Cognitive Optimization & Attention</strong> – techniques and states (from memory systems to contemplative practice) that enhance mental performance or regulate focus.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Leadership & Creative Practice</strong> – skill-building for high-leverage roles and sustainable creative careers that hasn’t yet folded into the Core “Creative Process & Productivity” interest.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Tech-Futures Ethics & Governance</strong> – long-term thinking and moral analysis around emerging technologies, genetic selection, and far-future scenarios.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>AI Dynamics</strong> – surprising or little-understood emergent behaviors in AI systems that sit adjacent to, but aren’t yet central within, the AI Core Interest.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Infrastructure Resilience & Security</strong> – systemic approaches to keeping physical and digital infrastructure robust against failure or attack.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Public Systems & Policy Design</strong> – complex-systems views on public-health policy, regulation, and institutional architecture (distinct from day-to-day partisan politics).</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Culture, Language & Society</strong> – anthropological lenses on technology plus linguistic and cognitive diversity research that reveal how culture shapes thought.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Open Web & Digital Commons</strong> – governance, sustainability, and advocacy for shared digital resources and open platforms.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Game Facilitation</strong> – psychology and techniques for running engaging tabletop or live-action games; supports (but isn’t yet promoted into) the Role-Playing Games Core Interest.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>RPG Mechanics Innovation</strong> - Novel approaches to traditional tabletop systems that solve common gameplay issues or create new player experiences.</li>\n</ul>\n",

				"content_html": "<p>I wanted to try something new this week and give an end-of-week status report. No idea if this is something I’ll keep doing, but the best way to figure out if it’s useful (to me or anyone else) is to give it a try.</p>\n<p>The majority of this week has been spent working on the website for WizardHQ, a project that all my friends know about, but if you don’t know me personally this is the first time you’re hearing about it. I don’t intend to try to advertise it at this exact moment, please excuse me being vague for now. More to come on that in the next few weeks, but for right now it’s eating up a considerable amount of time.</p>\n<p>Last week I crawled the <a href=\"https://thewizardly.com/2025/03/27/my-project-for-the-evening.html\">TTRPG thought space</a> and that gave me the idea that maybe I could build a small search engine to do this. “Small” is doing a lot of lifting there. But I think it might be a useful community service to crawl the TTRPG blogosphere and make that easy for people to search. It’s a win-win. Discoverability for small creators, ease of finding for players and GMs.</p>\n<p>I spent time during one of my lunch breaks and got the bones of a crawler written.

				"content_text": "<p>I wanted to try something new this week and give an end-of-week status report. No idea if this is something I’ll keep doing, but the best way to figure out if it’s useful (to me or anyone else) is to give it a try.</p>\n\n<p>The majority of this week has been spent working on the website for WizardHQ, a project that all my friends know about, but if you don’t know me personally this is the first time you’re hearing about it. I don’t intend to try to advertise it at this exact moment, please excuse me being vague for now. More to come on that in the next few weeks, but for right now it’s eating up a considerable amount of time.</p>\n\n<p>Last week I crawled the <a href=\"https://thewizardly.com/2025/03/27/my-project-for-the-evening.html\">TTRPG thought space</a> and that gave me the idea that maybe I could build a small search engine to do this. “Small” is doing a lot of lifting there. But I think it might be a useful community service to crawl the TTRPG blogosphere and make that easy for people to search. It’s a win-win. Discoverability for small creators, ease of finding for players and GMs.</p>\n\n<p>I spent time during one of my lunch breaks and got the bones of a crawler written. None of the “crawl more links” parts, but I can point it at a single page and get all the needfuls from it.

Oh the hubris of one week ago me thinking I might not have anything to read on my next flight.</p>\n<p>I should probably be surprised, or ashamed, or <em>surpshramed</em> at how little I’d engaged with the TTRPG community. There’s no excuse for it. For something I claim to care so much about, I had invested so little. Except for the literal investment. In money.

				"title": "2024 Year End Battle Report",
				"content_html": "<p>Every December my partner and I make the drive down to the Warhammer Citadel in Grapevine, TX to play our end-of-year game. If you&rsquo;re a fan of Warhammer but have never been to the Citadel, imagine a Games Workshop or Warhammer store that&rsquo;s also a coffee shop. It&rsquo;s the closest thing we have in North America to <a href=\"https://warhammerworld.warhammer-community.com/explore-warhammer-world/\">Warhammer World</a>, but it&rsquo;s closer to a normal Warhammer store than that statement might imply.</p>\n<p>Still, as the North American headquarters for Games Workshop, it has the benefit of being fully stocked with even the rare and unusual games, lots of well-painted minis on display, and probably 20 open tables in the back. It&rsquo;s worth a trip if you&rsquo;re in town, but not a trip to town if that makes sense. But I digress.</p>\n<p>At the start of 2024 we determined to play a full 2000 point game, my <a href=\"https://warhammer40k.fandom.com/wiki/Tyranids\">Tyranids</a> vs his <a href=\"https://warhammer40k.fandom.com/wiki/Death_Guard\">Death Guard</a>. Then my year exploded. Suddenly it was September and I didn&rsquo;t have a single painted model to show for it. What I did have, however, was almost all the <a href=\"https://warhammer40k.fandom.com/wiki/Necrons\">Necrons</a> I&rsquo;d need for a Boarding Action. So we pivoted, and rather than try to rush 100+ unpainted models, I finished the roughly ~11 for our new goal.</p>\n<p>The Necrons had been a previous year&rsquo;s army of the year, so I have a decent set of them in various states of completion, and we were big fans of Boarding Actions which came out around the transition from 9th to 10th edition Warhammer, so this was a delightful return to form.</p>\n<p>So, how did it go?</p>\n<h3 id=\"before-the-battle\">Before the Battle</h3>\n<p>In the current edition of Warhammer you determine who goes first by rolling a six-sided die (d6,) and whoever rolls higher goes first. That person also picks who is the &ldquo;attacker&rdquo; and who is the &ldquo;defender.&rdquo; The attacker and defender have different deployment zones, places where they can put their minis on the table at the start of the game, and the defender has to put their minis down first. It&rsquo;s useful to be able to go second in the deployment phase, because where your opponent puts their minis tells you something about their strategy and can allow you to make last-minute strategic decisions about how to respond.</p>\n<p>I won the roll-off, which meant that I would get to go first, and I chose to be the attacker, which meant that I got to deploy second.</p>\n<p>We each held one unit in reserve to be deployed through strategic shenanigans later. He had a unit of <a href=\"https://www.warhammer.com/en-US/shop/Death-Guard-Poxwalkers-2021\">Poxwalkers</a> that he could deep strike (place anywhere on the table that was at least 9&quot; away from one of my models,) through the usage of a limited resource called Command Points. I had a unit of <a href=\"https://www.warhammer.com/en-US/shop/Ophydian-Destroyers-2020\">Ophydian Destroyers</a> that have deep strike as a natural ability.</p>\n<p>A few more units were held in reserve to come in through the normal deployment mechanism, because Boarding Actions allows a limited number of units to be in the deployment zones each round.</p>\n<h3 id=\"round-1\">Round 1</h3>\n<img class=\"pure-img\" src=\"https://thewizardly.com/uploads/2024/img-1005.jpeg\" alt=\"This image shows a Warhammer 40,000 tabletop game in progress, viewed from above. The battlefield is set up with reddish-brown modular walls creating a maze-like pattern of corridors and rooms across a dark gaming board. The board itself features detailed circuit-like patterns, and the walls are connected by turquoise decorative elements at their intersections. Several groups of painted miniature figures are positioned around the board, representing different armies with distinct color schemes - some darker units and some in yellower tones. A few yellow objective markers are scattered across the battlefield, and gaming accessories like a water bottle and small containers for dice or tokens can be seen at the board's edges.\">\n<p>During my turn I advanced my unit of <a href=\"https://www.warhammer.com/en-US/shop/Necrons-Flayed-Ones-2021\">Flayed Ones</a>, one unit of <a href=\"https://www.warhammer.com/en-US/shop/Necron-Warriors-2020\">Warriors</a> and my <a href=\"https://www.warhammer.com/en-US/shop/necrons-royal-warden-2023\">Royal Warden</a> towards the central objective. The Royal Warden was my Warlord, which I think is sort of an unusual choice. He&rsquo;s basically a slightly more powerful Warrior, and in the regular 40K rules he gives an attached unit of Warriors the ability to run away and shoot in the same turn. In Boarding Actions he shouldn&rsquo;t be able to do that, but as a house rule we decided that he could because it&rsquo;s flavorful, and we think in the spirit of what the rules intended.</p>\n<p>In the Northwest corner I moved my unit of <a href=\"https://warhammer40k.fandom.com/wiki/Canoptek_Scarab\">Scarabs</a> to claim the objective. We wouldn&rsquo;t figure out until round three that they had no objective control score, which meant they couldn&rsquo;t actually claim that objective for me. One of my lessons learned!</p>\n<p>Finally, I moved my unit of <a href=\"https://www.warhammer.com/en-US/shop/Necron-Triarch-Praetorians-2020\">Triarch Praetorians</a> to capture the objective in the Southwest corner.</p>\n<p>On his turn Ash moved his unit of <a href=\"https://www.warhammer.com/en-US/shop/Chaos-Spawn-2016\">Chaos Spawn</a> to claim the Northeast objective, then advanced his Poxwalkers and <a href=\"https://www.warhammer.com/en-US/shop/Death-Guard-Typhus-2020\">Typhus</a> to open a hatchway into the southern corridor.

The most obvious change is the positioning of the miniature units - there appears to have been significant movement of troops across the battlefield after the first round of play. The darker-colored units (which appear to be grey/metallic in tone) have advanced further into the maze-like corridor structure on the left side of the board, while the yellower-toned units are now more concentrated on the right side.\">\n<p>Seeing that Ash intended to make use of Hatchways to get into the Northern and Southern hallways, I redirected units in both of those directions. To the North I ran my Flayed Ones into his unit of Poxwalkers. It was an immediate and decisive victory for the Flayed Ones, who eradicated the entire unit in one combat while taking no wounds.</p>\n<p>I deployed a unit of <a href=\"https://www.warhammer.com/en-US/shop/Necron-Lychguard-2020\">Lychguard</a> to the South to block another unit of Poxwalkers who were attempting to head for the Southwest objective. This was strategically one of Ash&rsquo;s better trades. The Lychguard have a relatively small number of incredibly strong attacks. Overall they were probably the strongest units either of us had brought, and in a perfect world I would have run them directly into his warlord, Typhus. Because their attacks were so strong, any Poxwalker they hit was guaranteed to melt, but because they had so few attacks they could only take out a few each round.</p>\n<p>Seeing his Chaos Spawn coming for the central objective, I deployed my Ophydian Destroyers via Deep Strike directly on to the central objective to both claim and protect it. It was clear to me that my relatively slow moving warriors weren&rsquo;t going to get there in time, and if he claimed it I&rsquo;d have trouble shifting him off.</p>\n<p>During Ash&rsquo;s turn he ran the Chaos Spawn directly into my Ophydians, dealing two wounds which wasn&rsquo;t quite enough to take one down. In the trade, my Ophydians did six wounds back, fully 3/4 of the damage his unit could sustain, and removing one of the two Chaos Spawn models.</p>\n<p>Using the stratagem &ldquo;The Dead Rise&rdquo; allowed him to deep strike his final unit of Poxwalkers into the far Northwest corner, aiming them for my poor solitary unit of Scarabs. However, they were unable to move on their first turn on the board.</p>\n<p>A unit of cultists in each of the Northeast and Southeast corners claim both objectives for him, and spend the next term &ldquo;securing&rdquo; the objectives, which would allow them to remain under his control as the units continued to move away. I forgot this was something units could do, and that specifically only my Warriors could do it. I had built my list assuming I&rsquo;d need to keep a unit on each objective I wanted to hold, which is why the Scarabs continued to sit in the Northwest corner. Since part of his strategy was to try to claim one of my back field objectives, this was probably the right idea regardless.</p>\n<h3 id=\"round-3\">Round 3</h3>\n<img class=\"pure-img\" src=\"https://thewizardly.com/uploads/2024/img-1007.jpeg\" alt=\"In this third image of the Warhammer 40k game, further tactical movements have occurred. The metallic/grey colored units on the left side have consolidated their position and appear to be engaging more directly with their opponents near the center of the board.

The overall battlefield structure remains unchanged, but the positioning of the armies suggests the battle has intensified around the central corridor area.\">\n<p>In the Southwest I advance one of my units of Warriors towards the objective, freeing up my Praetorians to advance to the center of the board.

				"content_text": "Every December my partner and I make the drive down to the Warhammer Citadel in Grapevine, TX to play our end-of-year game. If you're a fan of Warhammer but have never been to the Citadel, imagine a Games Workshop or Warhammer store that's also a coffee shop. It's the closest thing we have in North America to [Warhammer World](https://warhammerworld.warhammer-community.com/explore-warhammer-world/), but it's closer to a normal Warhammer store than that statement might imply.\n\nStill, as the North American headquarters for Games Workshop, it has the benefit of being fully stocked with even the rare and unusual games, lots of well-painted minis on display, and probably 20 open tables in the back. It's worth a trip if you're in town, but not a trip to town if that makes sense. But I digress.\n\nAt the start of 2024 we determined to play a full 2000 point game, my [Tyranids](https://warhammer40k.fandom.com/wiki/Tyranids) vs his [Death Guard](https://warhammer40k.fandom.com/wiki/Death_Guard). Then my year exploded. Suddenly it was September and I didn't have a single painted model to show for it. What I did have, however, was almost all the [Necrons](https://warhammer40k.fandom.com/wiki/Necrons) I'd need for a Boarding Action. So we pivoted, and rather than try to rush 100+ unpainted models, I finished the roughly ~11 for our new goal.\n\nThe Necrons had been a previous year's army of the year, so I have a decent set of them in various states of completion, and we were big fans of Boarding Actions which came out around the transition from 9th to 10th edition Warhammer, so this was a delightful return to form.\n\nSo, how did it go?\n\n### Before the Battle\nIn the current edition of Warhammer you determine who goes first by rolling a six-sided die (d6,) and whoever rolls higher goes first. That person also picks who is the \"attacker\" and who is the \"defender.\" The attacker and defender have different deployment zones, places where they can put their minis on the table at the start of the game, and the defender has to put their minis down first. It's useful to be able to go second in the deployment phase, because where your opponent puts their minis tells you something about their strategy and can allow you to make last-minute strategic decisions about how to respond.\n\nI won the roll-off, which meant that I would get to go first, and I chose to be the attacker, which meant that I got to deploy second.\n\nWe each held one unit in reserve to be deployed through strategic shenanigans later. He had a unit of [Poxwalkers](https://www.warhammer.com/en-US/shop/Death-Guard-Poxwalkers-2021) that he could deep strike (place anywhere on the table that was at least 9\" away from one of my models,) through the usage of a limited resource called Command Points. I had a unit of [Ophydian Destroyers](https://www.warhammer.com/en-US/shop/Ophydian-Destroyers-2020) that have deep strike as a natural ability.\n\nA few more units were held in reserve to come in through the normal deployment mechanism, because Boarding Actions allows a limited number of units to be in the deployment zones each round.\n\n### Round 1\n<img class=\"pure-img\" src=\"https://thewizardly.com/uploads/2024/img-1005.jpeg\" alt=\"This image shows a Warhammer 40,000 tabletop game in progress, viewed from above. The battlefield is set up with reddish-brown modular walls creating a maze-like pattern of corridors and rooms across a dark gaming board. The board itself features detailed circuit-like patterns, and the walls are connected by turquoise decorative elements at their intersections. Several groups of painted miniature figures are positioned around the board, representing different armies with distinct color schemes - some darker units and some in yellower tones. A few yellow objective markers are scattered across the battlefield, and gaming accessories like a water bottle and small containers for dice or tokens can be seen at the board's edges.\">\n\nDuring my turn I advanced my unit of [Flayed Ones](https://www.warhammer.com/en-US/shop/Necrons-Flayed-Ones-2021), one unit of [Warriors](https://www.warhammer.com/en-US/shop/Necron-Warriors-2020) and my [Royal Warden](https://www.warhammer.com/en-US/shop/necrons-royal-warden-2023) towards the central objective. The Royal Warden was my Warlord, which I think is sort of an unusual choice. He's basically a slightly more powerful Warrior, and in the regular 40K rules he gives an attached unit of Warriors the ability to run away and shoot in the same turn.

This was his first major tactical mistake, as he forgot entirely to attempt to claim the Southeastern objective this round.\n\nHe repeated that strategy in the north with another unit of Poxwalkers and his [Tallyman](https://www.warhammer.com/en-US/shop/Death-Guard-Scribbus-Wretch-2020).\n\n### Round 2\n<img class=\"pure-img\" src=\"https://thewizardly.com/uploads/2024/img-1006.jpeg\" alt=\"In this updated view of the Warhammer 40k game, several changes are noticeable from the first image.

				"content_text": "The society I happen to have been born into is based on consumption. It tells me that my worth is measured in my economic contributions. That I will be judged by the clothes I wear, the car I drive, the establishments I frequent.\n<!--more-->\n\nI've had enough. Generally. Broadly. And also, in some cases, specifically. In just about every way it makes sense to measure, I've had enough.\n\nI reject the premise. I rebuke thee. I cast thee out.\n\n# The Year of Enough\n\nSo begins the Year of Enough, my next yearly theme. The astute may have noticed that it's technically still 2024, and that's true, but immaterial. Yearly themes need not align perfectly to arbitrary notions of time. What's important is that they are useful to the person undertaking them. Consider it another way I abjectly refuse to adhere to the role society would like me to play. This year, my year starts on December 1, 2024.\n\nAnything worth starting is worth starting **now**.

At its core, it means no unplanned spending. Of money. Of time. Of effort. Of energy. I have enough. Enough material goods. Enough things to do. Enough recommendations. Enough.\n\nThe best yearly themes are conceptually simple, but deep. Enough lands right in that sweet spot. It applies to almost every category I could mention. Whatever it is I almost certainly have enough of it. In many cases I have too much. It works as a response to every exhortation. Enough.\n\nWhat does this look like in practice? In many ways like a \"buy nothing\" year, with some notable exceptions. Travel and time spent with friends remain important to me, and I'll continue to prioritize those. I'm not cancelling any of my planned trips. Some of those trips are to new and novel places, and may require me to buy some things to be appropriately prepared, and any necessary purchases along those lines are pre-approved.\n\nThere's also some furniture for the house that I will need as the remodel completes, and that list has been specifically defined.

I'm not trying to live an ascetic life. Well. At least not yet. Maybe someday I'll go full-on recluse, but not today. \"Enough\" means no more of the things I'm already sated on. It doesn't mean suffering through obvious deficiencies.\n\nThis means that, among other things, I am no longer accepting recommendations. For shows to watch, movies to see, music to listen to. One category already bursting at the seams of enough is \"things to do.\" I will try to return the favor as best I can. Nobody I know is really suffering a surfeit of free time, and it would be rude to inundate them with my own recommendations while politely declining theirs. Know that if you ask, I have them in ready supply, but you will need to ask. This is as much for your own benefit as it is mine.\n\nSomething I failed to do last year was define success.\n\nAt the end of the Year of Enough, I think success would look like:\n- Every room in the house is clean, organized, and there are no unsorted \"piles\" of things in need of a place to live.\n- There is enough time in the day to do work I enjoy doing, to care for my meat chariot, and to pursue an interest or hobby.\n- Nothing I consider important is languishing.

Being able to tell people about the thing I want to build removes all of the urgency around building it so that I can show them. So, I'm sorry if it makes this post a bit harder or more frustrating to read.\n\nSo I've got this idea to build a thing, and the reasons I originally wanted to build it are kaput. But maybe I should still build it anyway? That's the process I'm currently working through (by which I mean my friends and family are suffering through.) Fortunately, I think I can distill it down into one big pro and one big con.\n\n**PRO** - I think this thing could be the chewy nougaty center around which an interesting community develops. The thing itself may not be viable for any of its original intended purposes, but I love building communities.\n\n**CON** - This will, like everything, suffer the opportunity cost of all the other things I'm not doing instead. Of which there are many, because I have too many hobbies.\n\nThere's a core risk / reward decision to be made here. I could choose to spend that time doing many other things, some of which would be a lot more materially productive. But I will note, and it has been noted to me, that I have never been as visibly \"excited\" to be working on a project in the entire time my partner has known me. There's a certain magic about this kind of thing, and anything that brings the magic and vibrancy this idea has brought probably ought not to be ignored.\n\nSo, sorry for the vagueness. With luck, someday, I'll be able to talk more concretely about it. Either because it exists, or because I have decided it never will.\n",

On the rare occasions that I see people doing this, it results in a lot of&hellip; Well. Let&rsquo;s call it &ldquo;feedback.&rdquo; So many people are accustomed to a perfect score being baseline from which complaints are subtracted that giving something that&rsquo;s essentially okay a 50% is likely to result in outrage from people that would agree with you that it&rsquo;s basically fine. The problem isn&rsquo;t that they think it&rsquo;s better than you do, it&rsquo;s that they think that mediocrity deserves a 90%+ score.</p>\n<p>Again, it seems to me this is primarily an American thing.</p>\n<p>Maybe it&rsquo;s because I see absolutely no value in maintaining the status quo where it doesn&rsquo;t make any sense to me, I&rsquo;ve never used this style of rating. Usually that means I need to publish a rubric.</p>\n<p>For example, here&rsquo;s my rubric for recipes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>1 star: not good as-is, could be redeemed. Research and try again.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>2 star: one person liked this, but not both.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>3 star: we both liked this and would like to have it again.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>4 star: very good, should make once per month.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>5 star: the very best, should make every week.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Three stars is a perfectly fine recipe that we both liked. There&rsquo;s literally nothing wrong with it.</p>\n<h2 id=\"okay-but-so-why\">Okay, but, so&hellip; Why?</h2>\n<p>I&rsquo;m in the process of setting up <a href=\"https://rpggeek.com/\">RPGGeek</a> as the place to track my project of reviewing all these RPG books. They inherited a 10-star rating system from BoardGameGeek. I think it&rsquo;s awful, that&rsquo;s far too many stars, but the communities on that site have done a surprisingly good job of fighting back against rating inflation. The absolutely highest-rated board game has achieved an average rating of 8.60 with almost 50k votes.</p>\n<p>But still, I disagree a bit with their published rubric. It&rsquo;s better than most, but I think still trends towards assuming that something basically okay should have a score of 6.</p>\n<p>For RPG items, they publish this:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>10 - Outstanding. Rules and concepts well presented and a near perfect fit to your play style. Excellent writing. Excellent Editing. Highly consistent throughout. You would highly recommend this book/product.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>9 - Excellent. Same as 10 but lacking in one or more of the elements (writing style, editing, consistency).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>8 - Very Good. Rules and concepts are a good fit to your play style with some reservations. Solid writing. Solid Editing. Highly consistent throughout.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>7 - Good. Same as 8 but lacking in one of the elements (writing style, editing, consistency).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>6 - Above Average. Rules and concepts are a reasonable fit to your play style but there are significant sections which you would change or not use in actual play. Solid writing. Solid Editing. Highly consistent throughout.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>5 - Average. Same as 6 but lacking in one of the elements (writing style, editing, consistency).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>4 - Below Average. Rules and concepts are not a great fit to your play style and there are significant sections which you would change or not use in actual play. You would cherry pick a few ideas from such a book and discard the rest. Solid writing. Solid Editing. Highly consistent throughout.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>3 - Well Below Average. Same as 4 but lacking in one of the elements (writing style, editing, consistency).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>2 - Poor. Rules and concepts are not likely to mesh at all with your play style and there are precious few things you can cull from this book to use in your actual play. Solid writing. Solid Editing. Highly consistent throughout.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>1 - Horrible. Same as 2 but lacking in one of the elements (writing style, editing, consistency).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It&rsquo;s more thought than I see most sites giving the problem, but I want to propose an alternative.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>5 - Average. You would play this game. There is nothing particularly good nor bad about it. It&rsquo;s fine.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Okay, what moves us up the scale from a 5? I can think of three areas of analysis: mythos, production, mechanics.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Mythos</strong> - How interesting is the game&rsquo;s world? How evocative is the writing? Am I excited about the stories it wants to tell?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Production</strong> - How well-produced is the book? Art, writing, graphic design. How do the materials feel? Is this an object of beauty?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Mechanics</strong> - How playable is the game? Does it provide systems that are fun to engage with? How portable are those systems?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So let&rsquo;s pin a perfect 10 in our scale.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>10 - Outstanding. The world is vibrant and interesting, the stories are evocative. The item is finely produced and would be worthy of display. It is an art object in and of itself. The mechanics are interesting, clearly presented, and weave together to support the stories of the mythos.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And with that, I think we can pin a 1.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>1 - Horrible. This item has no redeeming qualities. The stories are not interesting, the world lacks color and flavor. The item itself is utilitarian and otherwise poorly produced. You would not want people to see it on your bookshelf. The mechanics offer nothing new or interesting. Best case scenario it&rsquo;s a retread of something other games have done better.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This scale lends itself really well to a four star system, where a book with none of these things would be a 1, and if it had all three it&rsquo;d be a perfect four. But I don&rsquo;t get to set the system on RPGGeek. One option is to map my system on to theirs. My four-star would be their 10-star, and then down by 3 for each intermediary. 10, 7, 4, and jump to 1 in the worst case. This has benefits and weaknesses. The best argument against it is that it loses granularity. What if there&rsquo;s one really good system, but the rest is trash? What if the cover is truly beautiful, but the pages inside phoned it in?</p>\n<p>I can smooth out my system by taking my three axis ratings and giving each a half-step version that differentiates between &ldquo;they did this one thing really well&rdquo; and &ldquo;the whole system knocks it out of the park.&rdquo;</p>\n<h2 id=\"so-then-i-created-a-spreadsheet\">So then I created a spreadsheet&hellip;</h2>\n<p>It turns out there&rsquo;s an &ldquo;easy&rdquo; solution to this problem. If by easy you mean &ldquo;Contrariwise is a crazy person who is totally unreasonable.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Say it with me. (Or don&rsquo;t.) &ldquo;Weighted averages.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Imagine my three categories above: mythos, production, and mechanics. I can grade each of those on a scale from 1-5 where:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>5 - It knocked it out of the park in this category, the whole item is a delight throughout.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>4 - The item mostly succeeded, with a small number of critiques.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>3 - It&rsquo;s fine.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>2 - There&rsquo;s one or two redeemable qualities or systems, but mostly this ain&rsquo;t it chief.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>1 - Nope. No thanks.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>If I rate each category on that scale, 1-5, then I can calculate the average of all of those rankings and arrive at a percentage. 5/5 in all three gets you a ten. 3/5 in all three gets you a five.

It&rsquo;s in pristine condition and was a pretty penny in the bookstore&rsquo;s rare book room. I usually prefer to buy play copies, because Toys Are Meant to be Played With, but sometimes with these old TTRPG books it&rsquo;s either buy the perfect copy at collector&rsquo;s prices or accept I won&rsquo;t own it.

It went directly on a shelf, because I don&rsquo;t currently have the capacity to do anything with it, but I remember being charmed by the concept and thinking it might be light enough to convince some local friends to pick up casually without having to resort to digital play.

I think part of why it&rsquo;s that good is that it&rsquo;s meant to be a limited duration event, which means that it can be fun in a way which is not also trying to prolong my subscription past its natural lifespan. It&rsquo;s not trying to sell me any DLC.</p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s a reminder that somewhere in the shambling husk of Blizzard Activision is the beating heart of the company that made Warcraft 3 and Diablo 2. That, if they weren&rsquo;t in the throes of a dark insanity known as shareholder primacy, they might actually be capable of doing the one thing anyone actually wants them to do: making a good game.</p>\n<p>I hope they keep this format and go on to do it for other expansions.

Unrelated to that, I was able to find a copy of [Prelude to War](http://www.itcamefromthebookshelf.com/2022/01/earthdawn-1e-prelude-to-war.html) at a local(-ish) used book store, leaving only four books missing from my 1e Earthdawn collection.\n\nAt the same time I also picked up [The Complete Sha'ir's Handbook](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Complete_Sha%27ir%27s_Handbook), which is wizard archetypes for the old D&D setting of [Al-Qadim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Qadim). It's in pristine condition and was a pretty penny in the bookstore's rare book room. I usually prefer to buy play copies, because Toys Are Meant to be Played With, but sometimes with these old TTRPG books it's either buy the perfect copy at collector's prices or accept I won't own it. Even play copies are rare. These old D&D settings are interesting to me, and the books are often very \"of their time\" in an almost charmingly unaware way. Nobody who wrote this book had ever heard the word appropriation, and it usually shows.\n\nThe hardbound copy of [Yazeba's Bed and Breakfast](https://possumcreekgames.com/pages/yazebas-bed-breakfast) finally arrived. It went directly on a shelf, because I don't currently have the capacity to do anything with it, but I remember being charmed by the concept and thinking it might be light enough to convince some local friends to pick up casually without having to resort to digital play. With all due apologies to people who can only ever get their gaming group together on Discord, it's not the same.\n\n### World of Warcraft\n[WoW Remix: Mists of Pandaria](https://www.wowhead.com/guide/wow-remix-mists-of-pandaria-overview) is probably the best and smartest thing Blizzard has done since Wrath of the Lich King. No I don't think I'm being hyperbolic. It's that good. I think part of why it's that good is that it's meant to be a limited duration event, which means that it can be fun in a way which is not also trying to prolong my subscription past its natural lifespan. It's not trying to sell me any DLC. \n\nIt's a reminder that somewhere in the shambling husk of Blizzard Activision is the beating heart of the company that made Warcraft 3 and Diablo 2. That, if they weren't in the throes of a dark insanity known as shareholder primacy, they might actually be capable of doing the one thing anyone actually wants them to do: making a good game.\n\nI hope they keep this format and go on to do it for other expansions. I'd be especially glad to see it of Shadowlands, the one expansion I never got around to playing.\n",

				"content_html": "<p>Language is hard. Communication is harder. When someone receives a communication, they interpret it through their own understanding and world view and the message that&rsquo;s ultimately received may bear only a passing resemblance to the one that was intended. Ideally, we&rsquo;re all working to get better at communicating what we actually intend, since the burden is on the communicator to be understood, not the receiver to interpret.</p>\n<p>With this in mind, I&rsquo;m writing this as something of a preemptive &ldquo;disambiguation&rdquo; of some terms I intend to use in future blog posts with two intentions in mind:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>I want to be clear with myself what these words mean and how I should use them, so that hopefully I do not make the mistake of using them in the wrong way such that other people are less likely to understand me.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>I want to be clear with everyone else how I am intending to use these words, for the same reason as above.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>In the end my goal is to &ldquo;think in public&rdquo; about the world in a way that helps me understand it better. With any luck, that might also help some other people understand it better, or at least understand me better.</p>\n<h2 id=\"defining-ground-truth\">Defining &ldquo;Ground Truth&rdquo;</h2>\n<p>When I use the term &ldquo;ground truth&rdquo; I am referring to to what other people might call &ldquo;objective reality.&rdquo; These are the things we, as a society, &ldquo;know.&rdquo; Usually through direct observation, measurement, and empirical evidence.</p>\n<p>The earth is round. This is ground truth. Some people &ldquo;believe&rdquo; otherwise. Beliefs are derived from ground truth, but they do not influence ground truth. Our ability to understand ground truth is imperfect, and we may be wrong about some parts of it, but the preponderance of credible sources currently agree.</p>\n<p>Often, but not always, it is possible for you to demonstrate ground truth through your own observation or empirical measurement. Eratosthenes of Cyrene <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/2012/06/june-19-240-b-c-the-earth-is-round-and-its-this-big/\">demonstrated the earth was round in 240 B.C.</a> using shadows, an experiment you can run yourself with an afternoon&rsquo;s lazy drive in the car.</p>\n<h2 id=\"defining-belief\">Defining &ldquo;Belief&rdquo;</h2>\n<p>When I use the term &ldquo;belief&rdquo; I am referring to the entire host of things which a person might hold to be either true or false, but which cannot be empirically proven. These are the things you might &ldquo;know&rdquo; which are not ground truth.</p>\n<p>Beliefs are often based on our understanding of ground truth, but sometimes they&rsquo;re not. There are things people believe to their core that have no basis in our shared objective reality. Where people (myself included) get themselves into trouble is conflating the things we happen to believe with truth. I absolutely believe all of the things that I believe happen to be true. I also acknowledge the statistical likelihood of that is approximately zero.</p>\n<p>The closer you can get your beliefs to ground truth, the more valuable your insights become.

				"content_text": "Language is hard. Communication is harder. When someone receives a communication, they interpret it through their own understanding and world view and the message that's ultimately received may bear only a passing resemblance to the one that was intended. Ideally, we're all working to get better at communicating what we actually intend, since the burden is on the communicator to be understood, not the receiver to interpret.\n\nWith this in mind, I'm writing this as something of a preemptive \"disambiguation\" of some terms I intend to use in future blog posts with two intentions in mind:\n\n1) I want to be clear with myself what these words mean and how I should use them, so that hopefully I do not make the mistake of using them in the wrong way such that other people are less likely to understand me.\n\n2) I want to be clear with everyone else how I am intending to use these words, for the same reason as above.\n\nIn the end my goal is to \"think in public\" about the world in a way that helps me understand it better. With any luck, that might also help some other people understand it better, or at least understand me better.\n\n\n## Defining \"Ground Truth\"\n\nWhen I use the term \"ground truth\" I am referring to to what other people might call \"objective reality.\" These are the things we, as a society, \"know.\" Usually through direct observation, measurement, and empirical evidence.\n\nThe earth is round. This is ground truth. Some people \"believe\" otherwise. Beliefs are derived from ground truth, but they do not influence ground truth. Our ability to understand ground truth is imperfect, and we may be wrong about some parts of it, but the preponderance of credible sources currently agree.\n\nOften, but not always, it is possible for you to demonstrate ground truth through your own observation or empirical measurement. Eratosthenes of Cyrene [demonstrated the earth was round in 240 B.C.](https://www.wired.com/2012/06/june-19-240-b-c-the-earth-is-round-and-its-this-big/) using shadows, an experiment you can run yourself with an afternoon's lazy drive in the car.\n\n\n## Defining \"Belief\"\n\nWhen I use the term \"belief\" I am referring to the entire host of things which a person might hold to be either true or false, but which cannot be empirically proven. These are the things you might \"know\" which are not ground truth.\n\nBeliefs are often based on our understanding of ground truth, but sometimes they're not. There are things people believe to their core that have no basis in our shared objective reality. Where people (myself included) get themselves into trouble is conflating the things we happen to believe with truth. I absolutely believe all of the things that I believe happen to be true. I also acknowledge the statistical likelihood of that is approximately zero.\n\nThe closer you can get your beliefs to ground truth, the more valuable your insights become. To yourself and to others. I only know of one way to do this, which is to take a cherished belief and really investigate it. Tear it down to its core and figure out why you believe it. Where did you learn the subset of things that made you believe that particular thing? Do they still hold up relative to the other things you know or believe? Beware of [cognitive dissonance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_dissonance).\n\n\n## Defining \"Principles\"\n\nWhen I say \"my principles\" what I really mean are the rules by which I live my life. They are not fundamental ground truth, although in many cases my intention is that they are reflective of it. They're decisions I've made about what's important, turned into systems.\n\nPrinciples are like an operating system. They're decisions made in advance about what's important, what matters, and how to respond to various stimuli.\n\nBeing vegetarian or vegan is a principle. It comes from a person's understanding of ground truth, their beliefs, and is ultimately codified in the pre-made decision about what they will or won't eat.\n\n## Other Terms\n\nI'm avoiding defining a few things: ideas, values. Probably others. I think for purposes of the kinds of things I'm intending to talk about what constitutes an **idea** won't matter, and **values** are just a specific subspecies of beliefs. There are some academic senses where the distinction matters, but I don't think it will here.\n\nThis should be enough of a shared lexicon to get where I'm trying to go, or at least to be able to define new terms along the way as necessary.\n",

The kind someone else might have created in high school and stuck with for the next 20 years. I was looking for something that could represent me, wasn&rsquo;t already taken everywhere, and wasn&rsquo;t directly associated with my day job or anything I&rsquo;ve done previously on the internet. Not entirely sure how I stumbled on the word, but &ldquo;<a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/contrariwise\">Contrariwise</a>&rdquo; was an instant hit among friends.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Please tell us the site name and its origin.</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I think I found TheWizardly through one of those &ldquo;help me think up a domain name&rdquo; services. It was around the time that the &ldquo;wizard ponders orb&rdquo; meme was going around, which I loved, and it was the driving force behind presenting myself as a random internet wizard.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>If you don&rsquo;t mind, please tell me your date of birth.</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I do mind.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>What does the site deal with?</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Whatever I&rsquo;m thinking about at the moment. I have a bad habit of responding to simple questions with an essay. Sometimes I think it makes sense to just publish the essay instead. I use my blog as something like the intersection between what very small amount of value I used to get out of Twitter, while also still being able to get lengthy when I want to. My experience is that people are busy and they mostly don&rsquo;t click links, so posting links to a blog from a microblog is a great way to make sure your blog never gets read. Having one stream that does both is, I think, the best I can get while still being respectful of other peoples' time and attention.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Please tell us your recommended content.</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<p>There&rsquo;s not much of a backlog to look at currently, but if you don&rsquo;t know me you might enjoy <a href=\"https://thewizardly.com/now/\">thewizardly.com/now/</a> which is perpetually out of date, but I think a rather good snapshot of my interests. If you also like some of those things, you might like my posts in general.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Is the content you are working on a hobby? Are you an aspiring professional (or already a professional)?</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Let&rsquo;s call it a hobby? I try to keep work entirely out of this stream. It&rsquo;d be neat to make some money doing some of my hobbies someday, but I&rsquo;m also not trying to turn any of them into &ldquo;jobbies.&rdquo;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Do you have any off-duty activities related to the content you are handling?</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<p>(In the context of Japanese society this question is asking if I do things like vend at conventions related to my hobbies.) Short answer? No.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Please let us know if there are any people or works that you are aiming for in the content you are handling.</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<p>(In situ this question is basically asking if I&rsquo;m aspiring to emulate anyone.) No. I&rsquo;m striving for authenticity. Not, like, &ldquo;branded authenticity.&rdquo; Actually just my real answers, thoughts, and perspectives. One of the reasons why I want to detach this identity from &ldquo;real me&rdquo; is that it allows me to be more real in every way that matters. The day job requires a brand. It requires emulation. This is more &ldquo;me&rdquo; than most people who ever meet me are likely to get.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Do you have a set update frequency and update time for your site?</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I&rsquo;m trying to post roughly weekly, just to build and maintain the habit. I don&rsquo;t kick myself too hard if it I miss it.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>For what maximum period have you stopped updating?</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Since starting this blog, I think at most a couple of weeks. However I&rsquo;ve gone &ldquo;radio silent&rdquo; on the internet for periods of years in other places.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Would you like to get more visitors?</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Yes, but only inasmuch as I always want to attract more of my tribe. I want more visitors who are legitimately interested in the kinds of things I talk about.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Are you happy with the feedback on the content?</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I&rsquo;m happy with all positive, constructive feedback. Reasonable people should be able to disagree about some things, and I&rsquo;m not particularly interested in the kind of vitriol that&rsquo;s standard in other parts of the internet. It&rsquo;s like we forgot, culturally, that it was possible to walk away and not say anything.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>What do you think about typos and broken links?</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<p>When I notice them, I fix them, but mistakes are the touch of a human&rsquo;s hand. I fear the world where no mistake is permitted far more than someone judging my typo.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Do you accept requests?</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I think this is probably intended for someone who has an artistic output. My artistic output is primarily words. I think I&rsquo;d take a suggestion on a topic to write about, if I thought I had anything to say, but I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;d take commissioned writing work.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Are there hidden pages?</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Not intentionally! I think I might have toyed around with some plugins on my host that are still technically enabled, but I haven&rsquo;t hidden anything with the intent of it being found.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Do you have another site?</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Several! All defunct. Haven&rsquo;t figured out what to do about that.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Do you allow links? If so, please let me know if there are any conditions.</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Certainly. I would prefer if links stay within the <a href=\"https://indieweb.org/\">IndieWeb</a>. I won&rsquo;t be entirely crushed if I end up linked somewhere out on the Commercial Web, if the end result of that is meeting more of my tribe.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Did you have any experience running another site before starting this one?</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I&rsquo;ve been running sites since the days of Geocities and Angelfire. It&rsquo;s probably for the best that I couldn&rsquo;t remember where any of those were, though. No idea if I&rsquo;m in <a href=\"https://archive.org/web/geocities.php\">the big Geocities dump</a>. Probably?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>What inspired you to create this site?</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I needed a place to be able to get thoughts out of my head but which also would allow me to interact with the <a href=\"https://indieweb.org/\">IndieWeb</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fediverse\">Fediverse</a>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>When was this site established?</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<p>2023/10/31.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Do you have any celebration plans for the opening anniversary?</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I don&rsquo;t think so! I probably won&rsquo;t even make note of it, if I notice.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Do you keep in mind events such as Halloween and Christmas, seasonal changes, and social trends when updating?</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Not even a little bit. Honestly I sometimes forget to keep those things in mind in day to day life.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Do you use SNS?</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<p>(&ldquo;SNS&rdquo; is the shorthand term that the Japanese use for &ldquo;social media&rdquo;.) Basically, no. The closest I get is this blog&rsquo;s federation to the Fediverse. You can follow me on Mastodon! I have an account on BlueSky that just reposts everything I post here, to make it easier for people to follow me there until they get <a href=\"https://atproto.com/guides/overview\">ATProtocol</a> fully up and working.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Please tell us why you dare to run a website in this SNS era.</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Because the slow web was a better web. And the small web still is, where it exists and you can find it. Computers are a miracle. We taught sand to think by hitting it with lightning. But that doesn&rsquo;t mean every invention that followed was a net positive for society. I don&rsquo;t think social media actually helps anyone, and I think I&rsquo;d have a pretty high burden of proof to change that prior.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Is there anything you keep in mind when running your site?</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Be honest. Be clear. Be kind. Nobody&rsquo;s ever changed their mind because someone yelled at them.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Is there anything that remains in your mind while running the site?</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I have a set of principals for engaging with the internet. I&rsquo;ve never written them down. I probably should. It includes not having any kind of intentional tracking on this site. It might be kind of neat to know how many people see it, but I can&rsquo;t preach with one hand that people shouldn&rsquo;t be tracked and then track them. I know that there are services that do a more respectful version of tracking, but I think the correct amount is none. For me and also for everyone else. We should not have opened this pandora&rsquo;s box.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Do you have any problems with site management?</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<p>No, I pay <a href=\"https://micro.blog/\">micro.blog</a> to do all the hard stuff for me.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Do you ever get embarrassed about content you posted a long time ago and delete it?</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t say I&rsquo;m embarrassed. There&rsquo;s definitely stuff I posted when I was young that is, how they say, &ldquo;cringe&rdquo; by modern standards. It&rsquo;s probably cached in Google and the Wayback machine, if you knew where to look, but I don&rsquo;t. I have never once, in my life, tried to search myself on Google. I think it&rsquo;s probably the correct position, and I&rsquo;d recommend it to everyone.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Have you ever thought about quitting the site?</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Not this one, but I&rsquo;ve basically &ldquo;quit&rdquo; others when they stopped making sense. Some of which were lost forever, which is a shame.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Do you have backups or other measures in place in case your site suddenly disappears?</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Not yet. I&rsquo;m not invested enough that I think it would be a catatrophe. At some point I know I&rsquo;ll need to set up some kind of archival solution for this site.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>If you were to die tomorrow, would you leave your website behind? Do you want to delete it?</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I think I&rsquo;d want to leave it. I suspect there are people that would come here, read what I typed, and they&rsquo;d hear it in my voice. And for a short period of time I&rsquo;d still be there. I think a piece of us lives on as long as we&rsquo;re still remembered and thought of. It would be real cool to be the kind of person that people think of long after I&rsquo;m gone.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Are you okay if your family or real-life friends and acquaintances see your site?</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<p>That&rsquo;s probably 90% of who&rsquo;s seeing it.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>How much of a difference do you think there is between your online image and your real-life personality?</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Less than you&rsquo;d imagine. Authenticity is part of the goal. The only place I&rsquo;m anything other than exactly who I am is work.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>What kind of people do you want to visit your site?</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Interesting weirdos. Kind people with strong opinions about making the world a better place and realistic plans for achieving it.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Are you registered for searches or rankings?</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I think I applied to be listed in an IndieWeb / Personal Blog list, but I never followed up and I have no idea if that ever happened. I could probably get listed on Google but I think it&rsquo;s pretty unlikely I&rsquo;d ever rank on any searches so it&rsquo;s not high up my list.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Are you part of an alliance?</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<p>(This is the Japanese equivalent of a webring.) No. I don&rsquo;t actually know how much those ever worked, if I&rsquo;m being honest. Someone out there probably used them a lot, but I didn&rsquo;t. Maybe if I found one that really seemed align with my kind of weirdo I&rsquo;d get hooked up, but I&rsquo;m not actively seeking that out.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Please tell me the service or server you are using.</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I&rsquo;m gladly hosted on <a href=\"https://micro.blog/\">micro.blog</a>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Why did you choose that service or server?</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<p>They do everything I think I need, at a completely reasonable price.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Do you use templates?</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The site layout is a template through <a href=\"https://micro.blog/\">micro.blog</a>. I don&rsquo;t use any templates in my post content. I&rsquo;ve thought about it, for something like a weekly review post. Maybe I will at some point.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>How well do you know the languages used to create homepages, such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP?</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I&rsquo;m fluent in all of those things, but prefer not to do it. I haven&rsquo;t written a line of PHP since probably 2006? HTML, CSS, and JS are all more recent, but I&rsquo;d rather not unless I absolutely have to.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>When operating your site, do you ever pay attention to the number of accesses and update frequency of other sites?</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Not at all. I try not to measure myself against others.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Please let me know if you have any recommendations for sites or books that support site production.</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Look at the source code for sites you think are doing something cool, and see if you can figure out how they did it. Don&rsquo;t steal their entire layout and style, that&rsquo;s what we call Not Cool, but the best way to learn in my experience is to figure out how someone did what you&rsquo;re trying to do.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>What is your working environment (devices, etc.)?</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Laptop: 2023 Apple Macbook Pro with M3 Pro.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Monitor: An HP 4K monitor, whose exact model number I don&rsquo;t recall.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Mouse: Logitech MX Master 3.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Keyboard: <a href=\"https://www.wasdkeyboards.com/wasd-v3-104-key-doubleshot-pbt-black-slate-mechanical-keyboard.html\">WASD 104-key</a> w/ custom keycaps designed to look like an old mainframe terminal.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Please tell me where and when you usually work.</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I work from home full time, from my tiny office filled with cool books.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Do you often listen to music, radio, etc. while working?</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Sometimes. I&rsquo;ve been listening to music the entire time I&rsquo;ve been writing this post. Frequently I need to interact with people, and I find that I need total silence for the deepest thought-work.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Is there a drink you often drink while working?</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Coffee!</p>\n</blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Do you think you will still be using this site in 10 years?</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Statistically speaking? No. But I hope that I&rsquo;m still an authentic participant in the small and indie web movements.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>What is your ideal site?</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<p>No JavaScript of any kind, for any reason.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Please let me know if there is anything you would like to do on the site in the future.</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I&rsquo;m still trying to figure out what this site could be, and I think playing is half the fun. My guess is as long as I keep trying new things, then I&rsquo;m doing the right thing.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Please give me one last comment.</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The internet is only as good as we make it. Don&rsquo;t cede ground to the corporate overlords. Be actively working to build the world you want to live in.</p>\n</blockquote>\n",

The kind someone else might have created in high school and stuck with for the next 20 years. I was looking for something that could represent me, wasn't already taken everywhere, and wasn't directly associated with my day job or anything I've done previously on the internet.

It was around the time that the \"wizard ponders orb\" meme was going around, which I loved, and it was the driving force behind presenting myself as a random internet wizard.\n\n- **If you don't mind, please tell me your date of birth.**\n> I do mind.\n\n- **What does the site deal with?**\n> Whatever I'm thinking about at the moment.

If you also like some of those things, you might like my posts in general.\n\n- **Is the content you are working on a hobby?

This is more \"me\" than most people who ever meet me are likely to get.\n\n- **Do you have a set update frequency and update time for your site?**\n> I'm trying to post roughly weekly, just to build and maintain the habit. I don't kick myself too hard if it I miss it.\n\n- **For what maximum period have you stopped updating?**\n> Since starting this blog, I think at most a couple of weeks. However I've gone \"radio silent\" on the internet for periods of years in other places.\n\n- **Would you like to get more visitors?**\n> Yes, but only inasmuch as I always want to attract more of my tribe. I want more visitors who are legitimately interested in the kinds of things I talk about.\n\n- **Are you happy with the feedback on the content?**\n> I'm happy with all positive, constructive feedback. Reasonable people should be able to disagree about some things, and I'm not particularly interested in the kind of vitriol that's standard in other parts of the internet. It's like we forgot, culturally, that it was possible to walk away and not say anything.\n\n- **What do you think about typos and broken links?**\n> When I notice them, I fix them, but mistakes are the touch of a human's hand. I fear the world where no mistake is permitted far more than someone judging my typo.\n\n- **Do you accept requests?**\n> I think this is probably intended for someone who has an artistic output. My artistic output is primarily words. I think I'd take a suggestion on a topic to write about, if I thought I had anything to say, but I don't think I'd take commissioned writing work.\n\n- **Are there hidden pages?**\n> Not intentionally! I think I might have toyed around with some plugins on my host that are still technically enabled, but I haven't hidden anything with the intent of it being found.\n\n- **Do you have another site?**\n> Several! All defunct. Haven't figured out what to do about that.\n\n- **Do you allow links? If so, please let me know if there are any conditions.**\n> Certainly. I would prefer if links stay within the [IndieWeb](https://indieweb.org/). I won't be entirely crushed if I end up linked somewhere out on the Commercial Web, if the end result of that is meeting more of my tribe.\n\n- **Did you have any experience running another site before starting this one?**\n> I've been running sites since the days of Geocities and Angelfire. It's probably for the best that I couldn't remember where any of those were, though. No idea if I'm in [the big Geocities dump](https://archive.org/web/geocities.php). Probably?\n\n- **What inspired you to create this site?**\n> I needed a place to be able to get thoughts out of my head but which also would allow me to interact with the [IndieWeb](https://indieweb.org/) and [Fediverse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fediverse).\n\n- **When was this site established?**\n> 2023/10/31.\n\n- **Do you have any celebration plans for the opening anniversary?** \n> I don't think so! I probably won't even make note of it, if I notice.\n\n- **Do you keep in mind events such as Halloween and Christmas, seasonal changes, and social trends when updating?**\n> Not even a little bit. Honestly I sometimes forget to keep those things in mind in day to day life.\n\n- **Do you use SNS?**\n> (\"SNS\" is the shorthand term that the Japanese use for \"social media\".) Basically, no. The closest I get is this blog's federation to the Fediverse. You can follow me on Mastodon! I have an account on BlueSky that just reposts everything I post here, to make it easier for people to follow me there until they get [ATProtocol](https://atproto.com/guides/overview) fully up and working.\n\n- **Please tell us why you dare to run a website in this SNS era.**\n> Because the slow web was a better web. And the small web still is, where it exists and you can find it. Computers are a miracle. We taught sand to think by hitting it with lightning. But that doesn't mean every invention that followed was a net positive for society. I don't think social media actually helps anyone, and I think I'd have a pretty high burden of proof to change that prior.\n\n- **Is there anything you keep in mind when running your site?**\n> Be honest. Be clear. Be kind. Nobody's ever changed their mind because someone yelled at them.\n\n- **Is there anything that remains in your mind while running the site?**\n> I have a set of principals for engaging with the internet. I've never written them down. I probably should. It includes not having any kind of intentional tracking on this site. It might be kind of neat to know how many people see it, but I can't preach with one hand that people shouldn't be tracked and then track them. I know that there are services that do a more respectful version of tracking, but I think the correct amount is none. For me and also for everyone else. We should not have opened this pandora's box.\n\n- **Do you have any problems with site management?**\n> No, I pay [micro.blog](https://micro.blog/) to do all the hard stuff for me.\n\n- **Do you ever get embarrassed about content you posted a long time ago and delete it?**\n> I wouldn't say I'm embarrassed. There's definitely stuff I posted when I was young that is, how they say, \"cringe\" by modern standards. It's probably cached in Google and the Wayback machine, if you knew where to look, but I don't. I have never once, in my life, tried to search myself on Google. I think it's probably the correct position, and I'd recommend it to everyone.\n\n\n- **Have you ever thought about quitting the site?**\n> Not this one, but I've basically \"quit\" others when they stopped making sense. Some of which were lost forever, which is a shame.\n\n- **Do you have backups or other measures in place in case your site suddenly disappears?**\n> Not yet. I'm not invested enough that I think it would be a catatrophe. At some point I know I'll need to set up some kind of archival solution for this site.\n\n- **If you were to die tomorrow, would you leave your website behind? Do you want to delete it?**\n> I think I'd want to leave it. I suspect there are people that would come here, read what I typed, and they'd hear it in my voice. And for a short period of time I'd still be there. I think a piece of us lives on as long as we're still remembered and thought of. It would be real cool to be the kind of person that people think of long after I'm gone.\n\n- **Are you okay if your family or real-life friends and acquaintances see your site?**\n> That's probably 90% of who's seeing it.\n\n- **How much of a difference do you think there is between your online image and your real-life personality?**\n> Less than you'd imagine. Authenticity is part of the goal. The only place I'm anything other than exactly who I am is work.\n\n- **What kind of people do you want to visit your site?**\n> Interesting weirdos. Kind people with strong opinions about making the world a better place and realistic plans for achieving it.\n\n- **Are you registered for searches or rankings?**\n> I think I applied to be listed in an IndieWeb / Personal Blog list, but I never followed up and I have no idea if that ever happened. I could probably get listed on Google but I think it's pretty unlikely I'd ever rank on any searches so it's not high up my list.\n\n- **Are you part of an alliance?**\n> (This is the Japanese equivalent of a webring.) No. I don't actually know how much those ever worked, if I'm being honest. Someone out there probably used them a lot, but I didn't. Maybe if I found one that really seemed align with my kind of weirdo I'd get hooked up, but I'm not actively seeking that out.\n\n- **Please tell me the service or server you are using.**\n> I'm gladly hosted on [micro.blog](https://micro.blog/).\n\n- **Why did you choose that service or server?**\n> They do everything I think I need, at a completely reasonable price.\n\n- **Do you use templates?**\n> The site layout is a template through [micro.blog](https://micro.blog/). I don't use any templates in my post content. I've thought about it, for something like a weekly review post. Maybe I will at some point.\n\n- **How well do you know the languages used to create homepages, such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP?**\n> I'm fluent in all of those things, but prefer not to do it. I haven't written a line of PHP since probably 2006? HTML, CSS, and JS are all more recent, but I'd rather not unless I absolutely have to.\n\n- **When operating your site, do you ever pay attention to the number of accesses and update frequency of other sites?**\n> Not at all. I try not to measure myself against others.\n\n- **Please let me know if you have any recommendations for sites or books that support site production.**\n> Look at the source code for sites you think are doing something cool, and see if you can figure out how they did it. Don't steal their entire layout and style, that's what we call Not Cool, but the best way to learn in my experience is to figure out how someone did what you're trying to do.\n\n- **What is your working environment (devices, etc.)?**\n> Laptop: 2023 Apple Macbook Pro with M3 Pro.\n\n> Monitor: An HP 4K monitor, whose exact model number I don't recall.\n\n> Mouse: Logitech MX Master 3.\n\n> Keyboard: [WASD 104-key](https://www.wasdkeyboards.com/wasd-v3-104-key-doubleshot-pbt-black-slate-mechanical-keyboard.html) w/ custom keycaps designed to look like an old mainframe terminal.\n\n- **Please tell me where and when you usually work.**\n> I work from home full time, from my tiny office filled with cool books.\n\n- **Do you often listen to music, radio, etc. while working?**\n> Sometimes. I've been listening to music the entire time I've been writing this post. Frequently I need to interact with people, and I find that I need total silence for the deepest thought-work.\n\n- **Is there a drink you often drink while working?**\n> Coffee!\n\n- **Do you think you will still be using this site in 10 years?**\n> Statistically speaking? No. But I hope that I'm still an authentic participant in the small and indie web movements.\n\n- **What is your ideal site?**\n> No JavaScript of any kind, for any reason.\n\n- **Please let me know if there is anything you would like to do on the site in the future.**\n> I'm still trying to figure out what this site could be, and I think playing is half the fun. My guess is as long as I keep trying new things, then I'm doing the right thing.\n\n- **Please give me one last comment.**\n> The internet is only as good as we make it. Don't cede ground to the corporate overlords. Be actively working to build the world you want to live in.\n",

It also claims to touch on some interesting ideas, like building a base, and I want to see how that&rsquo;s implemented.

Honestly I&rsquo;m just glad Brian Clevenger is still out there, doing his thing. This is somewhat me just kicking some money to a creator who brought me a lot of joy a very long time ago.

That&rsquo;s something I&rsquo;ve done before, and I think it can be a useful way to pace events that happen whether or not the players are paying attention. I&rsquo;m curious to see if there&rsquo;s a better way to do it. The adventure itself looks like it could also be interesting, but it&rsquo;s for a system I don&rsquo;t play, so it&rsquo;s probably going to serve as inspiration and not be something I ever use directly.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/eryksawicki/milk-bar-sci-fi-osr-roleplaying-in-post-communist-poland\">Milk Bar: sci-fi roleplaying in post-Soviet Poland</a> &ndash; Once again looking at the base building mechanics, although the setting is also wholly new to me.

It&rsquo;s a puzzle/riddle dungeon and it&rsquo;s system agnostic. The kind of thing I&rsquo;m likely to be able to slip into any campaign where it might be useful. Too many supplements want to give me more monsters, but I don&rsquo;t really need more monsters. I have too many already. A good puzzle that players might enjoy solving is hard to come by.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/dngnclub/dngn-club-relics-remastered-vol-1\">DNGN CLUB: Relics Remastered Vol. 1</a> &ndash; A kitchen sink of the author&rsquo;s best ideas.

What particularly caught my eye is the use of an origami fortune teller. I want to see how they make use of it as a mechanic.</p>\n<h2 id=\"things-im-not-backing\">Things I&rsquo;m Not Backing</h2>\n<p>These are projects that I&rsquo;m not getting for one reason or another, but I think they&rsquo;re cool and maybe you&rsquo;ll be interested.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/aethercorp/field-agent-handbook\">Field Agent Handbooks: Observancy Dept. 1924–28</a> &ndash; This is a cool idea, but I know to my teeth that I&rsquo;d never make any use of it. The idea doesn&rsquo;t seem to be pilferable. For the right person this would probably be a lot of fun, I&rsquo;m just not that person.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/josiahmoore/tiny-fables\">Tiny Fables</a> &ndash; The art on this is gorgeous, but it&rsquo;s for a system I don&rsquo;t play and don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ll pick up. The examples make it seem like it would be difficult to adapt any of it to the games I do play.</p>\n",

Stories rarely linger in the middle of the world ending.\n\n[Mystery Under Magi-Mart](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/bodieh/mystery-under-magi-mart) -- I think this might be a fun thing to run as a Line Entertainment \\[E\\]nforcer at PAX.\n\n[Beetle Knight](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/brookletgames/beetle-knight) -- You can be a moth.\n\n[The Tower - A System Agnostic Puzzle Dungeon Crawl](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/johnsonofair/the-tower-a-puzzle-dungeon-crawl) -- This hits a few highlights. It's a puzzle/riddle dungeon and it's system agnostic. The kind of thing I'm likely to be able to slip into any campaign where it might be useful. Too many supplements want to give me more monsters, but I don't really need more monsters. I have too many already. A good puzzle that players might enjoy solving is hard to come by.\n\n[DNGN CLUB: Relics Remastered Vol. 1](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/dngnclub/dngn-club-relics-remastered-vol-1) -- A kitchen sink of the author's best ideas. Some of the samples are evocative. I'm curious to see what can be pilfered.\n\n[Sentai & Sensibility RPG](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/9thlevel/sentai-and-sensibility) -- If you have never wanted to be simultaneously both the green Power Ranger and also Mr Darcy, then I'm not entirely certain that we can relate. But if you have, now is your chance.\n\n[Thrifty Trades of Fey](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/gametee/thrifty-trades-of-fey-zine-quest) -- I've backed just about everything [Gametee](https://gametee.co.uk/) have ever made and been delighted by all of it. What particularly caught my eye is the use of an origami fortune teller. I want to see how they make use of it as a mechanic.\n\n## Things I'm Not Backing\nThese are projects that I'm not getting for one reason or another, but I think they're cool and maybe you'll be interested.\n\n[Field Agent Handbooks: Observancy Dept. 1924–28](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/aethercorp/field-agent-handbook) -- This is a cool idea, but I know to my teeth that I'd never make any use of it. The idea doesn't seem to be pilferable. For the right person this would probably be a lot of fun, I'm just not that person.\n\n[Tiny Fables](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/josiahmoore/tiny-fables) -- The art on this is gorgeous, but it's for a system I don't play and don't think I'll pick up. The examples make it seem like it would be difficult to adapt any of it to the games I do play.\n \n",

Having never been to Hawaii, or indeed to any &ldquo;tropical&rdquo; or &ldquo;island&rdquo; destination, I tacked on a short mini-vacation the weekend before the work portion.

The American airport experience is designed to maximize suffering at every touchpoint. With an 8-hour direct flight basically all of Wednesday was dedicated to the trip. Here I want to shout out to American Airlines' premium economy, which made the experience significantly more comfortable. I&rsquo;d say it&rsquo;s roughly equivalent to Alaska Airlines' first class. The seats alone are worth the price of admission.</p>\n<p>When I stepped off the airplane, however, I felt the first moist slap of Hawaiian air and&hellip; Well. Have you ever heard of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_syndrome\">Paris syndrome</a>? The short version is that Paris is nothing at all like how it&rsquo;s presented in the movies, and when some people experience it &ldquo;in the flesh&rdquo; for the first time the delta between expectation and reality leads to a bunch of negative symptoms.</p>\n<p>I can&rsquo;t say it was exactly like that, but expectation definitely didn&rsquo;t match reality. I can&rsquo;t explain why it never occurred to me that Hawaii would be hot and humid, but it&rsquo;s not what I was prepared for. Mentally, physically, emotionally, financially. In retrospect the fact that I even wore a hoodie now strikes me as hilariously unprepared. But also I didn&rsquo;t even bring a pair of shorts.</p>\n<p>So I caught a Lyft to my hotel in Waikiki, turned the air conditioning as low as it could possibly go, and ordered <a href=\"https://www.hawaiianbarbecue.com/\">L&amp;L</a> on a delivery app. Wednesday was a write-off. I was asleep no later than 8pm Hawaiian time, though I think it may have been much closer to 6:30.</p>\n<h3 id=\"day-2---thursday\">Day 2 - Thursday</h3>\n<p>I woke up at 6am local time on this and every other day of my trip. No alarm. Apparently that&rsquo;s just when my body has decided it&rsquo;s time to get up these days. Side note to myself I wonder if there&rsquo;s something useful I could do with that information WRT my work schedule? Something to think about.</p>\n<p>Breakfast at the hotel. Perfectly acceptable.

On my way back I stopped at the ABC Store and picked up some coconut water before spending the majority of the day in my hotel room to enjoy the air conditioning and a book.</p>\n<p>Dinner was a tour of spam musubi from just about every place I could think of to get one.

Maybe it&rsquo;s less hard for people that don&rsquo;t suffer from perfectionism. It&rsquo;s hard for me. The ideal system is one which tracks itself, but those are few and far between and rarely support the other principles that matter to me.</p>\n<p>One of the things I want to improve on is how much time I spend on my hobbies. To be clear: it&rsquo;s currently not enough. I would like to spend more time on my hobbies. But I&rsquo;ve got a lot of other things competing for my time, and that means left to my own devices I won&rsquo;t naturally spend more time working on the things that I want to work on. So I&rsquo;m tracking it. Currently the form of that tracking is a daily tick box in my 2024 Hobonichi Techo Cousin. Pro: it&rsquo;s flexible to my needs. Con: it&rsquo;s hard to remember to look in the planner.</p>\n<p>I suppose I could talk about planners in general, the problem being that I absolutely adore the tactile feel of paper, but I don&rsquo;t find it very useful to try to manage my mostly-digital life with mostly-analog tools. There&rsquo;s occasionally value in enforcing the gap, and I think that I think better &ldquo;on paper,&rdquo; but I know that trying to move my calendar or todo list to paper would be foolhardy at best and catastrophic at worst.</p>\n<p>So, better or worse, I&rsquo;ve got a paper planner that I mostly don&rsquo;t use for traditional planning. But it gives me room to explore the space. Maybe these checkboxes are the path forward, maybe they&rsquo;re not, but they&rsquo;re much easier to change if I figure out something better than if I doubled-down on an app-based solution that would only ever work &ldquo;how it works,&rdquo; and likely require me to test 3-5 different apps to find the one that worked the way I needed it to. In my experience, apps are rarely a solution to any problems. They are frequently the problem I&rsquo;m attempting to solve.</p>\n<p>Last week&rsquo;s boxes were:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Up by 8</li>\n<li>Morning planning</li>\n<li>Apple rings</li>\n<li>40K</li>\n<li>Reading</li>\n<li>Sleep</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I&rsquo;ve already reworked that to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Awake on time</li>\n<li>30 minute walk</li>\n<li>Hobby</li>\n<li>Reading</li>\n<li>Asleep on time</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Most days I want to be up by 8, but not all, so generalizing the check makes it easier to set up my planner each week. A checkmark for whether or not I closed all my apple rings is somewhat redundant, since I can look that up at any time. Much more useful is to track whether I engaged in the behaviors that lead to the desired result. &ldquo;Hobby&rdquo; remains to be seen if it meets the need. The main hobby I want to do more of is Warhammer 40K, but it&rsquo;s not my only hobby and there are nights where I have commitments or obligations that consume the time I might otherwise spend. I suspect that one will change again, even though I don&rsquo;t yet know how I&rsquo;d change it.</p>\n<p>Reading deserves a special call-out. Arguably, it&rsquo;s a hobby, but it&rsquo;s one I&rsquo;ve struggled to maintain to my own satisfaction for nearly 20 years. In high school I was voracious, not least of which because I was often ignoring the teachers. I wish I had something approximating Goodreads data for how many books I used to read, but subjectively I&rsquo;d estimate a 2x-3x over my best year as an adult. I&rsquo;ve had the best luck setting aside time before bed to read, so that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ve done again, and that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m tracking. And then, to make sure I don&rsquo;t accidentally forget to sleep because &ldquo;just one more chapter,&rdquo; I track that I lay down to sleep on time. Midnight, for the curious.</p>\n<p>I like that paper gives me the freedom to try to figure out the best way to track this. And it&rsquo;s a physical object in the world that&rsquo;s harder to accidentally forget to update. Most importantly it&rsquo;s a place to start. Starting is often the hardest part.</p>\n",

A checkmark for whether or not I closed all my apple rings is somewhat redundant, since I can look that up at any time. Much more useful is to track whether I engaged in the behaviors that lead to the desired result. \"Hobby\" remains to be seen if it meets the need. The main hobby I want to do more of is Warhammer 40K, but it's not my only hobby and there are nights where I have commitments or obligations that consume the time I might otherwise spend. I suspect that one will change again, even though I don't yet know how I'd change it.\n\nReading deserves a special call-out. Arguably, it's a hobby, but it's one I've struggled to maintain to my own satisfaction for nearly 20 years. In high school I was voracious, not least of which because I was often ignoring the teachers. I wish I had something approximating Goodreads data for how many books I used to read, but subjectively I'd estimate a 2x-3x over my best year as an adult. I've had the best luck setting aside time before bed to read, so that's what I've done again, and that's what I'm tracking. And then, to make sure I don't accidentally forget to sleep because \"just one more chapter,\" I track that I lay down to sleep on time. Midnight, for the curious.\n\nI like that paper gives me the freedom to try to figure out the best way to track this. And it's a physical object in the world that's harder to accidentally forget to update. Most importantly it's a place to start. Starting is often the hardest part.\n",

It's time to say goodbye to comic books. I've done a terrible job of keeping up with them since I picked the hobby back up in May 2022, and rather than let them slowly continue to pile up in the living room I'm going to wind it down so that I can focus more on my keystone hobby goals for 2024. This Tyranid army isn't going to paint itself.\n\nIt's pretty clear that I still have at least three major time-sink hobbies, and I estimate that I could probably keep up with maybe two of them. One of the following probably needs to go:\n\n- Warhammer 40K (unlikely)\n- TTRPGs (unlikely)\n- Lorcana (... possibly.)\n\nLorcana doesn't take up that much time at the moment, because in practice I don't actually play it. I'm collecting cards on the chance that a future version of me decides it's more fun than the other options currently taking up that time. There exists a future version of me who wishes the current version of me were doing this, and until I'm certain I won't become that person it's cheap insurance. But I fully acknowledge I'm not actually doing anything with the cards at the moment.\n",
