				"content_text": "<p>Once upon a time if you asked a kid what they wanted to be when they grew up you’d get answers like “policeman” or “scientist.” I’m sure nowadays it’s YouTuber, Streamer, or Sentient Minecraft Block.</p>\n\n<p>Unfortunately for me, I still don’t know the answer to this question. I’ve got two options on the table and roughly six months to pick. But first, to make any of it make sense, we need to go back to the halcyon days of 19-<em>mumblemumble</em>.</p>\n\n<h2>Chapter 1</h2>\n\n<p>I was the unplanned, unwanted side effect of a single night of passion. </p>\n\n<p>This meant a lot of things, not least of which that my mother wasn’t prepared to have a child. She worked for <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planned_Parenthood\">Planned Parenthood</a> and they were not interested in having an unwed mother on staff. It didn’t really fit the image of the brand.</p>\n\n<p>This meant I arrived into the world with a parent who had no aspirations, no savings, and no job. An auspicious start. </p>\n\n<p>But I’m not here to talk shit about my mom. Whatever other disagreements we’ve had, which are many, she realized that she had a duty to the life she’d brought into this world, and that led her to go back to school. She got an associates of nursing, and spent the entire rest of her career as a geriatric care nurse.</p>\n\n<p>Why? It’s what my grandmother had done. And, to quote my mom, quoting my nana, “go into nursing and you’ll never receive a pink slip in your life.”<sup><a href=\"#fn1-2726\" id=\"fnr1-2726\" title=\"see footnote\" class=\"footnote\">1</a></sup></p>\n\n<p>For whatever semblance of success I’ve achieved in life, know this. I got here by a combination of clawing my way out of the dirt from whence I came, mentors who took kindly and saw potential in me, and an inexhaustible font of luck.</p>\n\n<p>I learned many things in my misspent youth. Several of them things I would need to go on to un-learn in pursuit of success. But key among them, the importance of steady and reliable work. There is not one member of my family who could provide me with a safety net. When I almost became homeless again in my 20s, only the grace of a family friend spared me.</p>\n\n<p>As a consequence, I’ve never had the luxury of batting for the fences. Following your passion is great advice for the middle-class with a parent’s basement you could land softly in if you fail. If you’ve ever wondered why I didn’t go found Facebook, or any of a thousand other things, this is why. Because even when I lived in an RV, I had no interest in sleeping in my car.</p>\n\n<h2>Chapter 2</h2>\n\n<p>I signed a contract to work in the video game industry on the literal day of my 18th birthday, not even having graduated High School. And it was awful. I have not one nice thing to say about it. Technically I shipped production code for an MMO. There’s a slim chance you’ve even played it.</p>\n\n<p>The video game industry was, and still is, a wildly abusive place to work. People do it for the love of the game. They do it because they’re passionate about what they do. Not knowing any better, I ran from it. I spent the next 10 years, give or take, trying to do anything else.</p>\n\n<p>I managed an arcade.</p>\n\n<p>I did data analysis for the American Red Cross.</p>\n\n<p>I did IT for a public university.</p>\n\n<p>And importantly, I spent as much money as the government would let me floating around community college. Trying to figure out any other option for what I could do with my life. Anything except work with computers.</p>\n\n<p>Which is why I was able to accrue basically every associates degree they offered, in a wide variety of topics. I think it’s plausible that I took all of the classes. All of them. Which was fascinating and I absolutely would do for the rest of my life if I could get paid to do it. Just audit 100 and 200 level community college classes. It’s the best.</p>\n\n<p>But when the money started to run dry, it became obvious that I needed to pick exactly one thing, and it needed to be something I could stick with. So I picked the safe thing. The thing that I knew I could do, and which would keep me employed. I transferred up to a state university, and I got my degree in Computer Science.</p>\n\n<p>And there’s the thing. I <strong>am</strong> good at it. My mother tells an apocryphal story about a time when she was in college and a professor set me up on a jailed terminal to keep me busy, and not five minutes later I had broken out.</p>\n\n<p>Ladies and gentlemen I’ve been hackin’ since <em>I was three.</em></p>\n\n<p>From 286s I scrounged together from trash my grade school was throwing away, to a Kaypro 4 that my mom managed to find used from a coworker. I’ve been tinkering on computers in any way I could as long as I could. I knew BASIC in 5th grade. I was fluent in C++ in 8th. I wrote a MUD for my senior project.</p>\n\n<p>The purpose of this is not to toot my own horn, although a think some occasional horn-tooting is valid. It’s to try to establish a crumb of <em>bona fides</em> in a forum where I’ve generally avoided mentioning anything about what it is that I do to provide economic value. As much as I wish I were the idle rich, I am not. I am a certified computer toucher.</p>\n\n<p>But see here’s the thing. While young-me thoroughly enjoyed the mysteries of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit\">thinking-sand-box</a>, adult-me mostly hates the blasted things.</p>\n\n<p>If I could figure out a way to make a living without ever turning on another computer in my life, without a significant degradation of quality of life from all the online friends I’d never talk to again? Dear reader I would reenact the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KinUMIS3Yc\">fax machine scene</a> from Office Space on every computer within a 10km radius.</p>\n\n<p>I have slowly been turning into <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jubal_Harshaw\">Jubal Harshaw</a> for about three decades with no sign of stopping now.</p>\n\n<p>Because I got backed into a wall by the limits of financial aid I “failed up” into a successful career as a computer toucher, which I have spent my nights and weekends trying to break free from ever since.</p>\n\n<h2>Chapter 3</h2>\n\n<p>Let us assume, for the sake of argument, that I have two career paths in front of me.</p>\n\n<p>On the one hand, I could become President of Earth.\nOn the other hand, I could become an Astronaut.</p>\n\n<p>Yes these are metaphors.</p>\n\n<p>There’s a lot to recommend President of Earth. With great power comes great responsibility, and great compensation. It represents the safe path, but is also a path that brings no real joy. I would be in great company, the world is filled with talented, driven, creative people that just need to pay the mortgage.</p>\n\n<p>As President of Earth, I would need to work longer hours, I would need to do many things I would not enjoy. But the satisfaction would come from the ways in which it would enable a comfortable life. In the knowledge that despite my upbringing, I climbed to the top. That I achieved to the very highest levels, despite it all. All the people who believed in me that I proved right. All the people who didn’t that I proved wrong.</p>\n\n<p>It’s unlikely that I could become President of Earth and then abandon the post. While all things remain possible, it requires <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_handcuffs\">making commitments</a> that will close other doors. </p>\n\n<p>The alternative is becoming an Astronaut. To pursue with wild abandon a result that most people never attempt. And of those who try, most never succeed. It is to chase the thing which is clearly my true passion, or as close as I think I have to one.<sup><a href=\"#fn2-2726\" id=\"fnr2-2726\" title=\"see footnote\" class=\"footnote\">2</a></sup></p>\n\n<p>It would be a risk of the highest magnitude, with an uncertain end. But the chance that maybe, just maybe, I’d land among the stars.</p>\n\n<p>However, to become an Astronaut I’d need to begin making changes. There would be a training regimen. A rocket must be constructed. For the next several years I would be engaged in the process of transforming myself into the kind of person who could go to space. That is wholly incompatible with the duties and responsibilities of President of Earth.</p>\n\n<p>Importantly, I would also need to build a landing pad. Because if I did not launch successfully, I would need a net to catch me. The kind that I have never had before, and which stopped me from ever trying anything this audacious in the past.</p>\n\n<h2>The Grand Question</h2>\n\n<p>Few things in life are certain, and nothing is guaranteed. But for reasons outside my control I believe I will need to commit to one path or another in the near future. If only because dithering about one will close the door.</p>\n\n<p>It does not mean that I’m planning any drastic changes (hi coworkers, if you’re reading this, I’m not planning to quit any time soon. I really like working where I work, inasmuch as I like working at all.)</p>\n\n<p>What I’m really talking about is setting the trajectory for where I want to be in five to seven years. Because I don’t think I’ll be happy staying exactly where I am.</p>\n\n<p>I either need to run for office, or start building a rocket, and it may be one of the hardest decisions I’ve ever had to make.</p>\n\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n<hr />\n<ol>\n\n<li id=\"fn1-2726\">\n<p>Demonstrably untrue.

				"content_text": "<p>Have you ever lost something and then spent the next ten years trying to find it?</p>\n\n<p>I have. It’s an essay about the fall of the Roman Empire. Did the average citizen know the empire had fallen?</p>\n\n<p>No. It took them about 200 years to figure out, but you’re just going to have to trust me because all the kings horses and all the king’s men haven’t been able to find that paper again.</p>\n\n<h2>All of this is backstory</h2>\n\n<p>Back in 2020 I got way into the idea of Personal Knowledge Management (PKM) and went about setting up my first “<a href=\"https://thesweetsetup.com/the-pkm-stack/\">PKM Stack</a>,” or set of tools for solving the problem: how do I stop losing all the interesting things I read.</p>\n\n<p>The first version of this stack used <a href=\"https://www.instapaper.com/\">Instapaper</a> as my read-it-later, IFTTT, Dropbox, and Obsidian. The workflow sucked. But the basic idea was I’d read something, if it had any highlights those would get put in a markdown file in Dropbox by IFTTT, and then I’d manually drag it over to Obsidian eventually.</p>\n\n<p>When AI first started taking off Instapaper used it as an opportunity to raise their rates, and not having been CRAZY happy with that solution, and not seeing any value in the then-state of AI, I used it as a chance to rethink, and ended up hopping to <a href=\"https://readwise.io/read\">Readwise Reader</a>.</p>\n\n<h2>Instapaper to Reader</h2>\n\n<p>When I migrated from Instapaper to Reader it was, by necessity, an imperfect migration. Instapaper’s output format included a link to the original document, the parts I had highlighted, but not the document text. Reader had to go out and fetch the document bodies again, and in a handful of cases failed. Either because Reader couldn’t parse it, or because the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Link_rot\">document was gone</a>.</p>\n\n<p>I also had the habit of archiving everything in the hope I would be able to find it later if I needed. This comes from deep trauma: I’m <strong>still</strong> looking for a paper I read a decade ago about whether the average imperial citizen knew the Roman Empire had fallen.</p>\n\n<p>The result is a large backlog of low-value things that I had read, and saved in case, that I was unlikely to ever look at again. Or find any value in if I did.</p>\n\n<h2>Reader to the Future</h2>\n\n<p>Reader is fine for, well, reading, but it’s got usability gaps for making notes and long-term storage. Especially since my primary modality for using it is on an iPad mini on a flight somewhere. Most of my life runs out of Obsidian, why not this?</p>\n\n<p>After thinking about it I decided that I want every document that I “archive” in Reader to go through an enrichment pipeline that summarizes it, extracts any highlights, extracts any key ideas or topics, and puts a markdown file in the right part of my Obsidian vault with all that information and a link back to the Reader copy, so that I can reference it if needed.</p>\n\n<p>To make it maximally useful, I needed to do this for everything in the archive, and to do that I needed to get rid of all the low-value documents hanging around in there.</p>\n\n<h2>How to Build A Rubric And Learn to Love the Atomic Bomb</h2>\n\n<p>Going through the entire archive was going to require a system that could look at everything and reliably decide what I should or shouldn’t keep. To do that, I needed to be able to describe what I would want to keep. I needed an interest rubric.</p>\n\n<p>Have you ever tried to describe yourself? Like really describe yourself? Maybe this is easier for other people but man I struggled. I came up with I think about four core interests, but I knew that wasn’t accurate.</p>\n\n<p>My next attempt was to open a conversation with Claude, explain to it what I was trying to do, and ask it to interview me. This was... Medium successful? It ended up being a much better place to start from but was not in and of itself nearly comprehensive. Again it continued to rely on the things I could think of to prompt it with.</p>\n\n<p>Finally I thought, okay. Well. I’ve got this backlog of things I’ve read. I know it’s got some stuff I want to get rid of, but it’s also filled with lots of stuff I’d want to keep. Can I use that as the basis for a rubric?</p>\n\n<p>Bingo.</p>\n\n<p>The next problem was purely technical. Over 700 documents, many running into the tens of thousands of words. There was going to be no way to put them all into Claude’s context at once. I thought about it and figured “good enough” might be “good enough” at scale: I had Claude write a series of Python scripts that would randomly sample about half of the documents and post them to an OpenAI batch job with the goal of summarizing and extracting key insights.</p>\n\n<p>I’m not certain if this was the absolute final version of the prompt, but it looked a lot like this:</p>\n\n<blockquote>Your task is to analyze this document and create a comprehensive summary that would allow someone to understand its core value without reading the full text.\n\nDocument Title: {doc['title']}\nAuthor: {doc.get('author', 'Unknown')}\nURL: {doc.get('url', 'Not provided')}\n\nContent:\n{doc['extracted_content'][:15000]}  # Truncate very long content\n\nPlease provide:\n\n1. A concise but information-dense summary (2-3 paragraphs) that captures the key ideas, arguments, and context of the document.\n\n2. 3-5 key insights or takeaways from the document that represent its most valuable content.\n\n3. A brief assessment of why this content might be valuable to someone with interests in rationality, economics, science fiction, fantasy, and tabletop role-playing games. If the content seems unrelated to these areas, explain what type of person might find it valuable instead.\n\nFormat your response as structured JSON with the following keys:\n\"summary\", \"key_insights\" (as an array), and \"value_assessment\".</blockquote>\n\n<p>I think of “summarize a bunch of text” as something Large Language Models (LLMs, such as Claude or ChatGPT) are good at. Perfect use case.</p>\n\n<p>My next step was to take the first Markdown file and the basis of my rubric from the interviews, and attach them to a conversation with Claude Sonnet 3.7 with Extended Thinking. I typed out like four paragraphs of stream-of-consciousness about what I was trying to do and asked it, in so many words: “based on all these summaries, what interests do you think I have that you don’t see on the rubric?”</p>\n\n<p>Thus began a long dialogue. It would propose, based on what it saw, what it thought I liked. I would correct, confirm, cajole, and provide insight. Why yes, I am deeply interested in Philosophy. Actually no I’m not that interested in international finance, that one article happened to be really interesting.</p>\n\n<p>Claude:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Governance and Legal Systems: Your reading suggests deep interest in specific governance mechanisms and legal frameworks beyond general institutional analysis. How central is this comparative approach to governance in your thinking?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Me:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>I think I'm interested in how the world works, and how it could be made to work better. How do we build a better world, or at least minimize the chances of a worse world. I don't think I'm specifically interested in governance and legal systems outside of that context.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Claude:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>There's a recurring pattern of interest in Philosophical Frameworks for analyzing complex issues. Would you consider this a hidden interest, or do you see it as simply an aspect of Rationality?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Me:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>I am definitely interested in philosophy and philosophical frameworks. If I didn't need to \"work for a living,\" I would strongly consider going back to school for a PhD in Philosophy. I think all of life's interesting questions are in the world of philosophy, and that it's a shame there's no way to make money doing it.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>At the end, I’d ask it to spit out an updated version of the rubric, which I would take to a new conversation with Claude, the next markdown file, and repeat the process. After the second round I asked it to provide me with a prompt that captured everything I was trying to do, which I used for all subsequent iterations of the conversation.</p>\n\n<p>The output of all these rounds was a several-kilobyte markdown file which accurately captures some, but not all, of my various interests. Not all my interests are captured in the things I read, and a random sampling was always bound to miss something. Nevertheless it’s good for what it got!</p>\n\n<p>If you think it’d be interesting to see the final result (either to see what we built, or to get a better sense of who I am as a person,) I’ll attach a lightly edited version at the end.</p>\n\n<h2>Actually Doing the Thing, for Exceptionally Large Values of Thing</h2>\n\n<p>Originally I was going to take my rubric and repurpose those scripts to have ChatGPT do the review, but I ran into a technical issue and had to pivot to Anthropic for this part. The ChatGPT batch API is convinced that I have batches in progress, even when I don’t and I can’t submit any more.</p>\n\n<p>Anthropic ended up working out well because their API will let you set a “system” prompt that is distinct from the “user” prompt. The entire rubric and guidance on the return format went into the system prompt, and the user prompt ended up being the document data.</p>\n\n<p>The first run, everything scored too high. Every document was a keeper, even ones I knew I didn’t want to keep.</p>\n\n<p>I adjusted the rubric slightly, and it got a little better.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, I added a point deduction metric for certain topics I knew I didn’t like, and that hit the sweet spot. The final run resulted in a markdown file reviewing everything in my Reader backlog that didn’t have highlights, and suggested around 83 deletions.</p>\n\n<p>I manually reviewed all suggested deletions, and agreed with all but one of them, which revealed an obvious gap in the rubric. Success! The “keeps” were lightly spot-checked. I don’t need it to be absolutely right about them, because the worst case there is that a future step of this project costs me a little extra money by doing enrichment on a document that has nothing of value to give. I’m not that worried about it.</p>\n\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n\n<p>So what I did I learn? I learned a lot about how batch jobs to OpenAI and Anthropic work. I learned a medium amount about my own interests. I feel like if I had any need to do it I could write an extremely good dating profile now. “Enjoys long walks in the forest and applied epistemology.” I learned a bit more about how to wrangle the best results out of the current state of LLMs.</p>\n\n<p>My next steps are to take everything I learned and built and begin working on the enrichment pipeline, which I think will look pretty similar in a lot of ways to start. Because I first need to deal with my archive, batch jobs are the most cost effective option. Eventually I’m imagining an AWS Step Function. All of which is better than Ghostreader. Most of which is better than nothing.</p>\n\n<p>Did this help me find my Roman Empire? Well, no. As far as I can tell that’s well and truly gone. But I think it’s improving the process by which I never let the Empire fall again.</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<h1>Personal Interest Rubric</h1>\n\n<h2>About the Reader</h2>\n\n<p>This rubric is designed for a

lessons</li>\n<li>Narrow policy analysis without broader principles or patterns</li>\n</ul></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Scoring Methodology</h2>\n\n<p>This rubric uses a point-based system with both positive criteria and penalties:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Calculate Positive Points</strong>: First, add all points from the Core Criteria (0-70 possible) and Bonus Criteria (0-30 possible) sections based on the document's strengths.</li>\n<li><strong>Apply Penalties</strong>: Next, subtract any applicable penalty points from the Topics to Avoid (-75 points per topic) or Content to Approach with Caution (-15 to -25 points per category) sections.</li>\n<li><strong>Determine Final Score</strong>: The resulting total represents the document's final score, which should be evaluated against the Final Score Interpretation scale.</li>\n<li><strong>Decision Rule</strong>: Documents scoring below 50 points after all calculations should be discarded, regardless of their initial positive score.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h2>Final Score Interpretation</h2>\n\n<ul>\n<li>90‑100: Exceptionally interesting – drop everything to read and deeply engage</li>\n<li>75‑89: Highly interesting – worth dedicated time and attention</li>\n<li>60‑74: Quite interesting – worth reading completely</li>\n<li>50‑59: Moderately interesting – skim for valuable sections</li>\n<li><strong>Discard threshold (below 50 points)</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Topics to Track</h2>\n\n<p>This section captures nascent topics that have appeared in my reading but haven't yet accumulated enough evidence to warrant promotion to core interests. Items here have typically appeared in 1-2 documents that resonated with me but don't yet demonstrate consistent engagement across multiple sources.</p>\n\n<p>I track these topics to identify patterns in my evolving interests. When I notice multiple high-quality pieces related to the same tracked topic over time, this signals a potential new core interest emerging. This approach helps me recognize genuine shifts in my intellectual focus rather than temporary curiosities.</p>\n\n<p>Each topic below represents a potential direction for future exploration that has shown some initial promise. They remain in this \"waiting room\" until sufficient evidence accumulates to justify promotion to a core interest.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Cognitive Optimization & Attention</strong> – techniques and states (from memory systems to contemplative practice) that enhance mental performance or regulate focus.</li>\n<li><strong>Leadership & Creative Practice</strong> – skill-building for high-leverage roles and sustainable creative careers that hasn’t yet folded into the Core “Creative Process & Productivity” interest.</li>\n<li><strong>Tech-Futures Ethics & Governance</strong> – long-term thinking and moral analysis around emerging technologies, genetic selection, and far-future scenarios.</li>\n<li><strong>AI Dynamics</strong> – surprising or little-understood emergent behaviors in AI systems that sit adjacent to, but aren’t yet central within, the AI Core Interest.</li>\n<li><strong>Infrastructure Resilience & Security</strong> – systemic approaches to keeping physical and digital infrastructure robust against failure or attack.</li>\n<li><strong>Public Systems & Policy Design</strong> – complex-systems views on public-health policy, regulation, and institutional architecture (distinct from day-to-day partisan politics).</li>\n<li><strong>Culture, Language & Society</strong> – anthropological lenses on technology plus linguistic and cognitive diversity research that reveal how culture shapes thought.</li>\n<li><strong>Open Web & Digital Commons</strong> – governance, sustainability, and advocacy for shared digital resources and open platforms.</li>\n<li><strong>Game Facilitation</strong> – psychology and techniques for running engaging tabletop or live-action games; supports (but isn’t yet promoted into) the Role-Playing Games Core Interest.</li>\n<li><strong>RPG Mechanics Innovation</strong> - Novel approaches to traditional tabletop systems that solve common gameplay issues or create new player experiences.</li>\n</ul>\n",

				"content_text": "<p>I wanted to try something new this week and give an end-of-week status report. No idea if this is something I’ll keep doing, but the best way to figure out if it’s useful (to me or anyone else) is to give it a try.</p>\n\n<p>The majority of this week has been spent working on the website for WizardHQ, a project that all my friends know about, but if you don’t know me personally this is the first time you’re hearing about it. I don’t intend to try to advertise it at this exact moment, please excuse me being vague for now. More to come on that in the next few weeks, but for right now it’s eating up a considerable amount of time.</p>\n\n<p>Last week I crawled the <a href=\"https://thewizardly.com/2025/03/27/my-project-for-the-evening.html\">TTRPG thought space</a> and that gave me the idea that maybe I could build a small search engine to do this. “Small” is doing a lot of lifting there. But I think it might be a useful community service to crawl the TTRPG blogosphere and make that easy for people to search. It’s a win-win. Discoverability for small creators, ease of finding for players and GMs.</p>\n\n<p>I spent time during one of my lunch breaks and got the bones of a crawler written.

				"content_text": "<p>We’re a couple days over one quarter of the way into the year, so I sat down and worked on a template for planning around my yearly theme.</p>\n\n<p>Part of a yearly theme is not to plan too hard. There’s a reason it’s not a yearly goal or, so help me, new years resolution. But I thought having some sort of light framework for checkin and intention setting would be useful, so that’s what I’m working towards.</p>\n\n<p>Here’s what I’ve got.</p>\n\n<h2>1. What Does This Theme Mean to Me Right Now?</h2>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Right now, today, I'm focusing on \"do we have enough\" in the sense of food to carry us through the uncertain times ahead. Even if shortages are not a concern, I think prices are likely to skyrocket, and the more I can insulate us from that the better off we'll be.</li>\n<li>When I originally wrote this theme I was thinking about \"enough\" in the sense of things I often had too much of. I have too many things to do. I eat too much. I spend too much money. I buy too many things.</li>\n<li>I think \"enough\" can be seen from both sides, or a right-sizing of things. Neither too little nor too much, broadly, across all categories in my life.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>2. What Am I Exploring with This Theme?</h2>\n\n<ul>\n<li>How do I know that I have enough?</li>\n<li>How do I add a circuit-breaker to that part of me that gets excited and jumps at opportunities to consider whether I already have enough?</li>\n<li>How do I release things when I have too much?</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<h2>3. What Does “more aligned” Vs. “less aligned” Look Like?</h2>\n\n<p><strong>More aligned with the theme:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Depth over breadth.</li>\n<li>Saying no.</li>\n<li>Thoughtful consumption.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Less aligned with the theme:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Buying things just to have.</li>\n<li>Trying to do everything.</li>\n<li>Avoiding hard trade-offs.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<h2>4. How Might This Theme Show up in Different Areas of Life?</h2>\n\n<p><strong>Work</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Delegating more, actioning less.</li>\n<li>Having energy and focus to spare.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Relationships</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>More, deeper connections with highly-aligned people.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Health</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>\"Eat not to dullness and drink not to elevation.\" - Benjamin Franklin</li>\n<li>Enough rest. More than I think I need. Rest before it becomes obvious I needed to.</li>\n<li>Build sustainable systems.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Time</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Live by the schedule so that free time can be truly free.</li>\n<li>Waste no time. Leisure is a valid activity, and should be engaged with by design.</li>\n<li>Anything that wants to pay me for my time, or worse, that I pay for with my time, should be considered anathema.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Environment</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Bring nothing home that has no place to live.</li>\n<li>Find the things which no longer spark joy and let them go.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>5. Integration Reminders</h2>\n\n<ul>\n<li>What would <em>enough</em> look like this week?</li>\n<li>Where am I doing <em>enough</em> to move my goals forward?</li>\n<li>Where am I doing <em>too much</em> in unhelpful ways?</li>\n<li>What could I let go?</li>\n</ul>\n",

				"content_text": "<p>It’s funny. The genesis of my gigantic TTRPG collection (almost certainly 500+ distinct books) was an old newsletter I used to write. I won’t link to it. It’s super defunct.</p>\n\n<p>But I thought, a hundred years ago, that there was a place in the world for someone to dig through these old games and find the best of their old ideas. Dust them off. Set them out on the table and see if anyone liked them.</p>\n\n<p>Which is of course a brilliant idea that people smarter than me have been doing for more than 20 years now. Oh well!</p>\n\n<p>And for better or worse, my life took a different turn and that’s not what ended up happening. But over time, as the collection has grown, I continue to think that I might really enjoy making a TTRPG of my own.</p>\n\n<p>Knowing full well there’s basically no money in it. Certainly less than I make doing <em>redacted</em> for <em>redacted</em>. Call it a passion project. A sickness. A warped twisting of a dark mind filled to the brim with moths and soup.</p>\n\n<p>But long before it would ever make sense to sit down and do that thing, I would need to find my community. A thought that, somehow, never occurred to me to try to do. Until like a couple weeks ago.</p>\n\n<h2>And so it begins...</h2>\n\n<p>I was, until about two weeks ago, following a grand total of maybe four TTRPG-related blogs. Come to think of it I’m not even sure when that started.</p>\n\n<p>Tonight, I fixed that. My project for the evening has been to trace the hidden veins of the TTRPG thought space, find all the blogs I wasn’t reading, and add them to my reader.</p>\n\n<p>My process was simple. Starting at the blog that’s been reliably the <a href=\"https://knightattheopera.blogspot.com/\">most interesting</a> I would spiral out, following link after link, adding whatever caught my attention. Whether it was a single post to Readwise, or the entire feed.</p>\n\n<p>Dear reader, I now have <strong>113</strong> unread articles in my feed. It was none on Monday. Oh the hubris of one week ago me thinking I might not have anything to read on my next flight.</p>\n\n<p>I should probably be surprised, or ashamed, or <em>surpshramed</em> at how little I’d engaged with the TTRPG community. There’s no excuse for it. For something I claim to care so much about, I had invested so little. Except for the literal investment. In money. Of buying 500+ TTRPG books.</p>\n\n<p>But as they say, it’s really the friends we made along the way.</p>\n\n<h2>... And I had made none.</h2>\n\n<p>It’s always difficult to introspect the self, and figure out why past-me did or didn’t do anything. I hardly know what now-me is doing and future-me is a radioactive orb of soup and malice.</p>\n\n<p>But I think the main reason I was living on an island was a secret fear that I might... I dunno. Read something and then be influenced by it? It’s ridiculous on the face of it. That’s literally the reason I bought all the RPG books.</p>\n\n<p>You see if I don’t know what all the cool kids with their hip new <a href=\"https://www.tuesdayknightgames.com/pages/mothership-rpg\">Motherships</a> and <a href=\"https://www.hauntedtable.games/\">Triangle Agencies</a> are doing, then how could I ever be guilty of <em>copying</em> them? I couldn’t. Infallible logic. Your move Aliens.</p>\n\n<p>This is of course insane.</p>\n\n<p>If there’s one thing I’ve learned about plagiarism, it’s that the first step is to <em>plagiarize</em> something. I’m not the kind of person who would copy someone else’s work and then try to pass it off as my own. (Well. Okay. I did do that once, in first grade. I “borrowed” someone else’s addition worksheet, because I hated math, erased their name, and put my own. Yes this is a true story. But I promise I don’t do that anymore.)</p>\n\n<p>Two people can independently have the same idea, or be inspired by the same thing, and maybe end up in the same neighborhood as each other, and that’s okay. Some people might try to claim one copied the other and those people are Wrong and should be put in Time Jail where they will be sat on by the Universe for all of Eternity or until they Feel Bad.</p>\n\n<p>Basically, this is not a thing I should be worrying about. If someone wants to make the legal claim I plagiarized them, then it’s time for lawyers to have a Polite Conversation about it. Until then, I’m not spending my time worrying what some rando on the internet thinks about the provenance of the art I’m trying to make.</p>\n\n<h2>Okay so then what?</h2>\n\n<p>Arguably, I should post more of my ideas on the internet. Part of that is because it’d be proof I had them first, but that’s a silly reason to do anything. Don’t spend your life fighting the argument against some future internet nerd with a Bad Opinion. Mainly because ideas are worthless and you should give them away for free anyway.</p>\n\n<p>Execution is the part that matters.</p>\n\n<p>Our society puts so-called “Idea Men” up on a pillar because it’s tactically useful to have a class of person who thinks their Next Big Idea is finally going to make them rich, while ignoring all the social and structural reasons it won’t. Ideas don’t make people rich. Working 16 hour days and a small $2million loan from your parents make people rich. The idea was secondary.</p>\n\n<p>The problem isn’t that I don’t want to do that. It’s that writing a TTRPG, or a setting for a TTRPG, is about the fifth thing down my project list. No. Really.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>That wizard community thing I keep hinting at.</li>\n<li>A SaaS app for exactly ten people that I cherish.</li>\n<li>This thing I’m calling the ORB which I am envisioning would sort of be like a digital museum exhibit for all of my classic TTRPGs and their ephemera.</li>\n<li>A SaaS app that might actually have a paying audience.</li>\n<li>Project Ashenreach. The codename for my TTRPG setting.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>See? Fifth.</p>\n\n<p>If you’re curious, I’m tracking 30 distinct projects in my project management system. A perfectly normal and well-adjusted number of projects for an adult human to have.</p>\n\n<p>Until then I’m following 23 distinct TTRPG-related blogs. I’m sure that number will thin over time. But it’s the start of actually trying to be present and aware. Of weaving myself into the fabric of a community that is ostensibly important to me.</p>\n\n<p>Someday, probably not soon, I’ll try to reach out to some of them and say hello. Make friends. With the other people crazy enough to do what I too also want to do. Someday.</p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p>My thoughts on working with AI have evolved a lot over the last year or so that I’ve been actively using them. </p>\n\n<p>I’ve gone from “this is an interesting toy, but it doesn’t seem very useful” to “wow, people are using this all the time and it gets important things wrong” to “actually if you’re smart about how you use it this can do some really useful things” to “I’m using this more and more every day, it seems unlikely that’s going to change.”</p>\n\n<p>Now I can see more and more of the places where not using AI, at least a little, is hurting me. Or at least slowing me down. In some cases that’s fine. I’m typing this by hand right now, and I know Claude could probably do it in about 7 seconds from a bulleted list of the points I want to make. The end result might even be better, in the sense that Claude is generally better at making easy-to-read content than I am.</p>\n\n<p>I type like I speak, and I speak like a college professor. That’s not meant to be a good thing. But it is what it is and it’s who I am.</p>\n\n<p>All that being said, I think I need to revisit my “100% Human Generated” policy. It’s still true, at least as of the time I’m writing this, but I think I’m missing out on an opportunity to at least collaborate with the machine. The sentiment that went into that policy is still absolutely core to my position: this blog is a craft to be honed, not a task to be automated.</p>\n\n<p>I gave a version of these thoughts to Claude, and asked it to help me craft a new policy. Over several rounds of iteration, fixing parts I didn’t like and mulling over suggestions I hadn’t considered, we arrived at something that I think represents a better way to handle the challenges I’m facing.</p>\n\n<h2>Human-Led, Collaborative Content Policy</h2>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>This blog remains fundamentally human-driven. All topics, ideas, and creative direction come from my own artistic sensibility and experiences. I sometimes collaborate with AI language models in my creative process, similar to working with a thoughtful writing partner who helps me refine and articulate my ideas.</p>\n\n<p>When and How I Collaborate with AI:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Refinement and focus: Sometimes I share my rough thoughts with an AI to help extract key ideas or sharpen my message</li>\n<li>Editorial dialogue: AI might help me restructure or clarify my existing ideas</li>\n<li>Creative exploration: Occasionally, through conversation with AI, we develop phrasings or explanations that effectively capture what I wanted to express</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>What Remains Purely Human:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>All topic choices and creative direction</li>\n<li>The initial ideas and perspectives being expressed</li>\n<li>The decision of what to publish and when</li>\n<li>The overall voice and style of the blog</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Transparency:\nWhen I collaborate with AI on a post in any substantial way, I'll acknowledge that collaboration and specify which AI I worked with. I believe in being honest about the role AI plays in my creative process while maintaining my commitment to human creativity and authentic expression.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>As mentioned previously, I worked on Claude with that. Claude Sonnet 3.5 to be precise, although I think in general I’m not going to specify exact versions. That gets into the weeds, and is also somewhat meaningless with how the frontier labs routinely update their models in meaningful ways without updating the name.</p>\n\n<p>I’m curious to see what people think about this new policy. I’m open to feedback before formally enacting it. Am I making some kind of huge tactical error by letting AI into my workflow? Are there things I should be drawing a line on that I’m neglecting entirely?</p>\n\n<p>Let me know.</p>\n",

				"content_text": "> “What a week, huh?”\n>\n> “Lemon, it’s Wednesday.”\n\n— <cite>30 Rock, S4E2 “Into the Crevasse”</cite>\n\nWithout exception, the smartest people I know are all in agreement that Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) is on the way in the next three years. That could mean a lot of things. Good things. Bad things. I think it’s reasonable to assume nobody can predict what the world will look like beyond that horizon.\n\nKurzweil’s [Singularity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Singularity_Is_Near) is finally near.\n\nLet me be clear: the Singularity is the moment beyond which we cannot imagine the future, because it is entirely different from the world we have always known. Dear gentle reader, I think that point is not more than a year or two from now.\n\nBut I’m not here to talk about AI or AGI or the Singularity, because that’s one way in which I think people are right to be worried. There’s the part where technocratic oligarchs have bought what remains of the American government, citizens are being deported to Guantanamo Bay, and airplanes are [falling](https://apnews.com/article/philadelphia-plane-crash-medical-transport-8617dab53471190832dd73db149489fa) out [of the sky](https://apnews.com/live/dc-plane-crash-reagan-updates).\n\nThe bad news keeps rolling in, and I think it’s reasonable to expect that it gets worse from here.\n\nThere will never come a point where the red tribe will wake up and realize “oh no, this isn’t what I voted for.” This *is* what they voted for.\n\nI know you desperately yearn for a “leopards ate my face” style realization of the atrocities they’ve caused. Will continue to cause. Are actively rejoicing in causing. That is not coming, and I need you to stop investing energy in waiting for it. There is work to be done.\n\nIf you’ll permit me a crumb of silliness in this tryin’ time, I’d like to present a framework that may help you figure out how you can help when everything feels hopeless, when it feels like the world is crumbling.\n\nPlease select from one of the following four class options:\n\n**Blanche**: Charming, debonair, slutty. First in line to shank a bitch out back the Waffle House at 3 AM if they even glance at one of her homies.\n\n**Sophia**: Wise, sardonic, unstoppable. A force of nature in the Greek God sort of way. Could correct Peter Jackson on what it sounds like when you stab someone in the lung.\n\n**Dorothy**: Intelligent, charismatic, truth to power. Plans on plans on plans. Why do physical violence when emotional violence works as good at half the price?\n\n**Rose**: St Olaf Stories as a finesse weapon. Emotional support  friend. Can a cheesecake be a familiar? Have some cheesecake. I SAID HAVE SOME CHEESECAKE.\n\nLook. I know it’s hard. But you need to figure out what you can do to help. Even if that’s taking care of yourself today so that you’re here to fight tomorrow.\n\nIt’s deeply unfair that we are called upon to fight this battle. Nevertheless, you are called. Nevertheless, you must fight.\n\nNevertheless, you must persist.\n",

You’re going to say goodbye to some things forever.’ I actually think that’s important because it’s a symbolic life change that says ‘I’m turning a corner.’ It’s a statement of ‘I’m making a permanent change.’ That’s important from both a psychological and nutritional standpoint.&rdquo;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>- Alton Brown</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In 2010&rsquo;s &ldquo;Live and Let Diet&rdquo; Alton Brown, host and creator of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_Eats\">Good Eats</a>, introduced what he called the &ldquo;System of Four Lists&rdquo; &ndash; effectively, a contract with himself that helped Brown build and maintain a 50lb weight loss. Each list was designed to either encourage good food choices, or discourage bad ones.</p>\n<p>The first list was comprised of things he decided he must eat every day:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Leafy greens</li>\n<li>Nuts</li>\n<li>Carrots</li>\n<li>Green tea</li>\n<li>Whole grains</li>\n<li>Fruits</li>\n</ul>\n<p>As I understand it, the purpose of focusing on things he must have rather than things he couldn&rsquo;t have, was to flood the playing field with good food. To leave less room for things that didn&rsquo;t support his desired health outcomes. Instead of focusing on restriction as the primary goal, to focus on nutrition to the exclusion of problematic foods.</p>\n<p>The second list are things he needed to eat at least three times a week:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Yogurt</li>\n<li>Broccoli / Cauliflower</li>\n<li>Sweet potato</li>\n<li>Avocado</li>\n<li>Oily fish</li>\n<li>Tofu</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Restriction enters the picture in his third list, the things he can only have once a week. Effectively, the treats:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Red meat</li>\n<li>White starch</li>\n<li>Desserts</li>\n<li>Alcohol</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In the original version of Live and Let Diet that aired, white starch was &ldquo;pasta,&rdquo; but in articles published later online it appears that he broadened it. My guess is by white starch what he really means is everything I think of as &ldquo;sugar.&rdquo; I have a notoriously broad definition of sugar, which extends pretty much all the way to all purpose flour. Any refined carbohydrate. So all breads are sugar, but a baked potato is not. Maybe he intended to include baked potatoes in his white starch category, I don&rsquo;t know. I think my problem probably isn&rsquo;t the number of baked potatoes I eat.</p>\n<p>Finally, the &ldquo;never&rdquo; list. The things he had to give up for good:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Soda</li>\n<li>Processed meals</li>\n<li>Canned soups</li>\n<li>&ldquo;Diet&rdquo; anything</li>\n<li>Fast food</li>\n</ul>\n<p>That seems clearly and objectively correct to me. There goes my chances of getting a Taco <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell-shaped_function\">Icosahedron</a> sponsorship, but I think that&rsquo;s probably a risk I&rsquo;m willing to take.</p>\n<p>Let me say that I really like this approach. I like the idea of filling up on healthy &ldquo;must haves&rdquo; to edge out less healthy alternatives. I like the idea of allowing a little fun as a once a week treat. I even like the idea of saying &ldquo;never&rdquo; to the things we all know are bad. There&rsquo;s power in never. Never reduces the option space, it removes an entire class of negotiation from the table. &ldquo;No&rdquo; is the most powerful word in the English language, and a complete sentence.</p>\n<p>My smart move is probably to take this, exactly as written, and try it for a month before I make any adjustments. And I think that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m going to aim to do. Just for the sake of completeness though, here are the adjustments I&rsquo;m considering:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Carrots are fine, but I&rsquo;m not a huge fan and I just can&rsquo;t think of how I&rsquo;d manage to fit them in every day without getting sick of them.</li>\n<li>I&rsquo;m not a huge tea drinker, green or otherwise, but I&rsquo;m game to try. I don&rsquo;t like hot beverages, but I think tea might be my best opportunity for replacing soda.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>That&rsquo;s it. Those are the changes I think I&rsquo;d want to make. But, let&rsquo;s give it an honest try first.</p>\n<p>&hellip; After I get back from Disney. Because it&rsquo;s only a couple weeks away, because the food at Disney is part of the appeal, and because it provides a break point to clear out my kitchen and refresh anew.</p>\n<h2 id=\"part-2---activity\">Part 2 - Activity</h2>\n<p>In October&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://www.relay.fm/cortex/148\">State of the Apps</a> CGP Grey talked about <a href=\"https://www.whoop.com/us/en/\">Whoop</a> and the extent to which the data it provided was a &ldquo;game changer&rdquo; for his health journey. I bought one immediately. Well. Rented. Their business model is to give you the device on pain of subscription. I&rsquo;ve been wearing it for over a month now, and its data collection is pretty impressive.</p>\n<p>With a month of basically &ldquo;normal&rdquo; baseline data, it has a good sense of how healthy I am (or am not,) and suggests some reasonable goals:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>More steps</li>\n<li>Better sleep</li>\n<li>Exercise a couple times a week</li>\n<li>Avoid added sugar</li>\n<li>Drink water</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Which, really, seems like very milquetoast advice. What&rsquo;s important is that it can mostly track those automatically, and suggest realistic goals based on how I&rsquo;m actually doing. Next week, for example, I&rsquo;m going to aim for 6600+ steps per day, a sleep consistency of 70%+, any exercise at least two days, no added sugar at least five days, and meeting my hydration goal at least five days. Then at the end of the week I&rsquo;ll review, adjust as necessary, and try again. Unlike the food plan, this starts immediately. Although I can&rsquo;t promise I&rsquo;ll avoid added sugar at Disney. Because Dole Whip.</p>\n<p>All of these systems, together, I&rsquo;m calling my Health Operating System. Like any other OS, I&rsquo;m sure they&rsquo;ll need patching and updates from time to time, but I&rsquo;m broadcasting it wide so that everyone who has to deal with me knows what&rsquo;s what. These are the things I&rsquo;m choosing to prioritize, and the rules I&rsquo;m willing to be inconvenient to maintain. Apologies in advance.</p>\n",

There goes my chances of getting a Taco [Icosahedron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell-shaped_function) sponsorship, but I think that's probably a risk I'm willing to take.\n\nLet me say that I really like this approach. I like the idea of filling up on healthy \"must haves\" to edge out less healthy alternatives. I like the idea of allowing a little fun as a once a week treat. I even like the idea of saying \"never\" to the things we all know are bad. There's power in never. Never reduces the option space, it removes an entire class of negotiation from the table. \"No\" is the most powerful word in the English language, and a complete sentence.\n\nMy smart move is probably to take this, exactly as written, and try it for a month before I make any adjustments. And I think that's what I'm going to aim to do. Just for the sake of completeness though, here are the adjustments I'm considering:\n\n- Carrots are fine, but I'm not a huge fan and I just can't think of how I'd manage to fit them in every day without getting sick of them.\n- I'm not a huge tea drinker, green or otherwise, but I'm game to try. I don't like hot beverages, but I think tea might be my best opportunity for replacing soda.\n\nThat's it. Those are the changes I think I'd want to make. But, let's give it an honest try first.\n\n... After I get back from Disney. Because it's only a couple weeks away, because the food at Disney is part of the appeal, and because it provides a break point to clear out my kitchen and refresh anew.\n\n## Part 2 - Activity\n\nIn October's [State of the Apps](https://www.relay.fm/cortex/148) CGP Grey talked about [Whoop](https://www.whoop.com/us/en/) and the extent to which the data it provided was a \"game changer\" for his health journey. I bought one immediately. Well. Rented. Their business model is to give you the device on pain of subscription. I've been wearing it for over a month now, and its data collection is pretty impressive.\n\nWith a month of basically \"normal\" baseline data, it has a good sense of how healthy I am (or am not,) and suggests some reasonable goals:\n- More steps\n- Better sleep\n- Exercise a couple times a week\n- Avoid added sugar\n- Drink water\n\nWhich, really, seems like very milquetoast advice. What's important is that it can mostly track those automatically, and suggest realistic goals based on how I'm actually doing. Next week, for example, I'm going to aim for 6600+ steps per day, a sleep consistency of 70%+, any exercise at least two days, no added sugar at least five days, and meeting my hydration goal at least five days. Then at the end of the week I'll review, adjust as necessary, and try again. Unlike the food plan, this starts immediately. Although I can't promise I'll avoid added sugar at Disney. Because Dole Whip.\n\nAll of these systems, together, I'm calling my Health Operating System. Like any other OS, I'm sure they'll need patching and updates from time to time, but I'm broadcasting it wide so that everyone who has to deal with me knows what's what. These are the things I'm choosing to prioritize, and the rules I'm willing to be inconvenient to maintain. Apologies in advance.\n",

				"content_html": "<p>Every December my partner and I make the drive down to the Warhammer Citadel in Grapevine, TX to play our end-of-year game. If you&rsquo;re a fan of Warhammer but have never been to the Citadel, imagine a Games Workshop or Warhammer store that&rsquo;s also a coffee shop. It&rsquo;s the closest thing we have in North America to <a href=\"https://warhammerworld.warhammer-community.com/explore-warhammer-world/\">Warhammer World</a>, but it&rsquo;s closer to a normal Warhammer store than that statement might imply.</p>\n<p>Still, as the North American headquarters for Games Workshop, it has the benefit of being fully stocked with even the rare and unusual games, lots of well-painted minis on display, and probably 20 open tables in the back. It&rsquo;s worth a trip if you&rsquo;re in town, but not a trip to town if that makes sense. But I digress.</p>\n<p>At the start of 2024 we determined to play a full 2000 point game, my <a href=\"https://warhammer40k.fandom.com/wiki/Tyranids\">Tyranids</a> vs his <a href=\"https://warhammer40k.fandom.com/wiki/Death_Guard\">Death Guard</a>. Then my year exploded. Suddenly it was September and I didn&rsquo;t have a single painted model to show for it. What I did have, however, was almost all the <a href=\"https://warhammer40k.fandom.com/wiki/Necrons\">Necrons</a> I&rsquo;d need for a Boarding Action. So we pivoted, and rather than try to rush 100+ unpainted models, I finished the roughly ~11 for our new goal.</p>\n<p>The Necrons had been a previous year&rsquo;s army of the year, so I have a decent set of them in various states of completion, and we were big fans of Boarding Actions which came out around the transition from 9th to 10th edition Warhammer, so this was a delightful return to form.</p>\n<p>So, how did it go?</p>\n<h3 id=\"before-the-battle\">Before the Battle</h3>\n<p>In the current edition of Warhammer you determine who goes first by rolling a six-sided die (d6,) and whoever rolls higher goes first. That person also picks who is the &ldquo;attacker&rdquo; and who is the &ldquo;defender.&rdquo; The attacker and defender have different deployment zones, places where they can put their minis on the table at the start of the game, and the defender has to put their minis down first. It&rsquo;s useful to be able to go second in the deployment phase, because where your opponent puts their minis tells you something about their strategy and can allow you to make last-minute strategic decisions about how to respond.</p>\n<p>I won the roll-off, which meant that I would get to go first, and I chose to be the attacker, which meant that I got to deploy second.</p>\n<p>We each held one unit in reserve to be deployed through strategic shenanigans later. He had a unit of <a href=\"https://www.warhammer.com/en-US/shop/Death-Guard-Poxwalkers-2021\">Poxwalkers</a> that he could deep strike (place anywhere on the table that was at least 9&quot; away from one of my models,) through the usage of a limited resource called Command Points. I had a unit of <a href=\"https://www.warhammer.com/en-US/shop/Ophydian-Destroyers-2020\">Ophydian Destroyers</a> that have deep strike as a natural ability.</p>\n<p>A few more units were held in reserve to come in through the normal deployment mechanism, because Boarding Actions allows a limited number of units to be in the deployment zones each round.</p>\n<h3 id=\"round-1\">Round 1</h3>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>During my turn I advanced my unit of <a href=\"https://www.warhammer.com/en-US/shop/Necrons-Flayed-Ones-2021\">Flayed Ones</a>, one unit of <a href=\"https://www.warhammer.com/en-US/shop/Necron-Warriors-2020\">Warriors</a> and my <a href=\"https://www.warhammer.com/en-US/shop/necrons-royal-warden-2023\">Royal Warden</a> towards the central objective. The Royal Warden was my Warlord, which I think is sort of an unusual choice. He&rsquo;s basically a slightly more powerful Warrior, and in the regular 40K rules he gives an attached unit of Warriors the ability to run away and shoot in the same turn. In Boarding Actions he shouldn&rsquo;t be able to do that, but as a house rule we decided that he could because it&rsquo;s flavorful, and we think in the spirit of what the rules intended.</p>\n<p>In the Northwest corner I moved my unit of <a href=\"https://warhammer40k.fandom.com/wiki/Canoptek_Scarab\">Scarabs</a> to claim the objective. We wouldn&rsquo;t figure out until round three that they had no objective control score, which meant they couldn&rsquo;t actually claim that objective for me. One of my lessons learned!</p>\n<p>Finally, I moved my unit of <a href=\"https://www.warhammer.com/en-US/shop/Necron-Triarch-Praetorians-2020\">Triarch Praetorians</a> to capture the objective in the Southwest corner.</p>\n<p>On his turn Ash moved his unit of <a href=\"https://www.warhammer.com/en-US/shop/Chaos-Spawn-2016\">Chaos Spawn</a> to claim the Northeast objective, then advanced his Poxwalkers and <a href=\"https://www.warhammer.com/en-US/shop/Death-Guard-Typhus-2020\">Typhus</a> to open a hatchway into the southern corridor. This was his first major tactical mistake, as he forgot entirely to attempt to claim the Southeastern objective this round.</p>\n<p>He repeated that strategy in the north with another unit of Poxwalkers and his <a href=\"https://www.warhammer.com/en-US/shop/Death-Guard-Scribbus-Wretch-2020\">Tallyman</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"round-2\">Round 2</h3>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>Seeing that Ash intended to make use of Hatchways to get into the Northern and Southern hallways, I redirected units in both of those directions. To the North I ran my Flayed Ones into his unit of Poxwalkers. It was an immediate and decisive victory for the Flayed Ones, who eradicated the entire unit in one combat while taking no wounds.</p>\n<p>I deployed a unit of <a href=\"https://www.warhammer.com/en-US/shop/Necron-Lychguard-2020\">Lychguard</a> to the South to block another unit of Poxwalkers who were attempting to head for the Southwest objective. This was strategically one of Ash&rsquo;s better trades. The Lychguard have a relatively small number of incredibly strong attacks. Overall they were probably the strongest units either of us had brought, and in a perfect world I would have run them directly into his warlord, Typhus. Because their attacks were so strong, any Poxwalker they hit was guaranteed to melt, but because they had so few attacks they could only take out a few each round.</p>\n<p>Seeing his Chaos Spawn coming for the central objective, I deployed my Ophydian Destroyers via Deep Strike directly on to the central objective to both claim and protect it. It was clear to me that my relatively slow moving warriors weren&rsquo;t going to get there in time, and if he claimed it I&rsquo;d have trouble shifting him off.</p>\n<p>During Ash&rsquo;s turn he ran the Chaos Spawn directly into my Ophydians, dealing two wounds which wasn&rsquo;t quite enough to take one down. In the trade, my Ophydians did six wounds back, fully 3/4 of the damage his unit could sustain, and removing one of the two Chaos Spawn models.</p>\n<p>Using the stratagem &ldquo;The Dead Rise&rdquo; allowed him to deep strike his final unit of Poxwalkers into the far Northwest corner, aiming them for my poor solitary unit of Scarabs. However, they were unable to move on their first turn on the board.</p>\n<p>A unit of cultists in each of the Northeast and Southeast corners claim both objectives for him, and spend the next term &ldquo;securing&rdquo; the objectives, which would allow them to remain under his control as the units continued to move away. I forgot this was something units could do, and that specifically only my Warriors could do it. I had built my list assuming I&rsquo;d need to keep a unit on each objective I wanted to hold, which is why the Scarabs continued to sit in the Northwest corner. Since part of his strategy was to try to claim one of my back field objectives, this was probably the right idea regardless.</p>\n<h3 id=\"round-3\">Round 3</h3>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>In the Southwest I advance one of my units of Warriors towards the objective, freeing up my Praetorians to advance to the center of the board. I knew that Typhus was headed that direction, and that they had a decent melee profile, so I wanted all of my best bruisers ready to hold the contest for the central objective.</p>\n<p>To the North I had my Flayed Ones open the hatchway towards the Northwest objective, positioning them to rescue my Scarabs on the following turn.</p>\n<p>On Ash&rsquo;s turn he managed to start making progress against a few of my units. One of his cultists got a lucky shot in the shooting phase and did the one wound needed to finish off one of my Ophydians. Poxwalkers continued to trade with my Lychguard in the south, taking one of them out as well. I also lost a Scarab to his risen Poxwalkers in the Northeast.</p>\n<p>He sent Typhus directly into my unit of Warriors, hoping to take them out in a single round. Unfortunately, he only managed to kill two.</p>\n<h3 id=\"round-4\">Round 4</h3>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>If you&rsquo;re not familiar with the Necrons, they&rsquo;re basically ancient space-faring robotic Egyptians. Basically. And they have a couple interesting gimmicks, but probably the one they&rsquo;re most well-known for is the ability to reanimate in the middle of combat. So sometimes you think you&rsquo;ve killed them, and then they stand right back up, stick their thumb to their nose, and blow a raspberry. And by blow a raspberry I mean they shoot you dead with plasma weapons.</p>\n<p>So that&rsquo;s what I did.</p>\n<p>Now would be a good time to thank the dice, who were exceptionally kind to me this day. More than half of the models that Ash had managed to kill stood back up, including both the Ophydian and Lychguard from the previous round. This was not a good outcome for him. It was a great outcome for me.</p>\n<p>In my movement phase I carefully arranged as many units as possible to be able to shoot at Typhus. The mission we were playing scored an extra 10 victory points for murdering the enemy Warlord. I got close to putting a wound on him a couple of times, and then my own Warlord, the Royal Warden actually managed to hit with six wounds. Exactly enough to kill Typhus. Both of Ash&rsquo;s saving throws failed, which should have killed Typhus, but he burned what remained of his precious command points to roll again and saved on the second attempt.</p>\n<p>What the Royal Warden couldn&rsquo;t do, the Ophydian Destroyers certainly could, and in the fighting phase they marched right in and turned Typhus into a fine plague-flavored sashimi.</p>\n<p>In the Northwest, my Flayed Ones came to the rescue of my Scarabs, and eradicated the Poxwalkers that were harassing them.</p>\n<p>At this point, with almost all of his Poxwalkers defeated, his Warlord dead, and me in control of more than half the board with strong units he would be unlikely to defeat, Ash conceded.</p>\n<p>I won 55 to 30.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<h3 id=\"my-learnings\">My Learnings</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Scarabs can’t claim objectives.

The battlefield is set up with reddish-brown modular walls creating a maze-like pattern of corridors and rooms across a dark gaming board. The board itself features detailed circuit-like patterns, and the walls are connected by turquoise decorative elements at their intersections. Several groups of painted miniature figures are positioned around the board, representing different armies with distinct color schemes - some darker units and some in yellower tones. A few yellow objective markers are scattered across the battlefield, and gaming accessories like a water bottle and small containers for dice or tokens can be seen at the board's edges.\">\n\nDuring my turn I advanced my unit of [Flayed Ones](https://www.warhammer.com/en-US/shop/Necrons-Flayed-Ones-2021), one unit of [Warriors](https://www.warhammer.com/en-US/shop/Necron-Warriors-2020) and my [Royal Warden](https://www.warhammer.com/en-US/shop/necrons-royal-warden-2023) towards the central objective.

The most obvious change is the positioning of the miniature units - there appears to have been significant movement of troops across the battlefield after the first round of play. The darker-colored units (which appear to be grey/metallic in tone) have advanced further into the maze-like corridor structure on the left side of the board, while the yellower-toned units are now more concentrated on the right side.\">\n\nSeeing that Ash intended to make use of Hatchways to get into the Northern and Southern hallways, I redirected units in both of those directions.

The metallic/grey colored units on the left side have consolidated their position and appear to be engaging more directly with their opponents near the center of the board. Some of the yellow-toned units have moved into what appears to be a more defensive position on the right side of the board, particularly around a circular feature in the terrain. The overall battlefield structure remains unchanged, but the positioning of the armies suggests the battle has intensified around the central corridor area.\">\n\nIn the Southwest I advance one of my units of Warriors towards the objective, freeing up my Praetorians to advance to the center of the board.

The metallic/grey units and yellow-toned forces are now heavily engaged in the central corridor area of the board, with units from both sides clustered around the middle section. Some of the yellow forces have repositioned near the top of the board, while maintaining their presence around the circular feature on the right side.\">\n\nIf you're not familiar with the Necrons, they're basically ancient space-faring robotic Egyptians.

The metallic/grey units and yellow-toned forces remain heavily engaged in the middle of the board, with what appears to be the largest concentration of units so far in the central corridor area. There's been some movement of the metallic units on the left side of the board, with fewer units visible in that area compared to the previous image.\">\n\n### My Learnings\n- Scarabs can’t claim objectives.

Probably they should have come out first and ranged ahead, so that the Poxwalkers would have had an easier time getting into position.\n- Typhus needs to be used more tactically, he’s not invincible. It came as a surprise when I killed him basically twice.\n\n### Final Thoughts\nThis was the only game of Warhammer we played in 2024, which is a real shame. We both love it. It's arguably part of how we met. I like the structure of having a game at the end of the year to work towards, because if nothing else we know that one game will happen.\n\nNext year we're focusing on Necromunda as our game of choice, which has much smaller armies (called gangs) than even Boarding Actions. I hope that by having a smaller painting commitment we'll be able to get into games sooner in the year, and our annual game next December will be the capstone of a campaign rather than the only game we play.\n\nIn closing, here is every one of his models my Necrons managed to take off the board. The real gift was the Poxwalkers we murdered along the way.\n\n<img class=\"pure-img\" src=\"https://thewizardly.com/uploads/2024/img-1010.jpeg\" alt=\"This image shows a close-up view of Warhammer 40k miniatures arranged on what appears to be a metal tray or container. In the background, there are approximately 20-25 infantry-sized models painted in a yellowish-green color scheme with various metallic and bright accent colors like turquoise and purple. In the foreground, there are three larger models on circular orange-tinted bases. These appear to be some type of alien creature models with pale flesh tones and distinctive tentacle or claw-like appendages. Two have reddish claws/tentacles, while the middle one features purple and blue tentacles. The models show detailed painting work, particularly in the blending of colors on the tentacles and the texture work on the bases.\">\n",

				"title": "On Generative AI",
				"content_html": "<p>I would describe myself as &ldquo;cautiously optimistic&rdquo; about generative AI. LLMs are clearly capable of doing some useful things. Anyone who tries to argue otherwise at this point probably sounds a lot like they&rsquo;re trying to argue the sky isn&rsquo;t blue or the moon isn&rsquo;t cheese.</p>\n<p>For a little background, I first heard about GPT-2 back when it came out, a couple of years before ChatGPT hit the world stage, and some of the smartest nerds I know were marveling at the fact that you could get it to play chess competently. This was a surprising result, because LLMs use statistical techniques against words to predict outputs given an input. It shouldn&rsquo;t know what &ldquo;chess&rdquo; is, and it shouldn&rsquo;t be competent at the game.</p>\n<p>Early ChatGPT didn&rsquo;t really impress me that much, and it routinely got stuff wrong. My best example of this would violate confidentiality, so consider that I&rsquo;m not necessarily trying to convince you that old ChatGPT sucked. I think that should be obvious. Mostly I&rsquo;m mentioning it to explain why I didn&rsquo;t even bother to start trying to use it or its competitors until much later.</p>\n<p>Once Google announced Bard, I joined that bandwagon and made a few slight attempts to get it to do something useful. It mostly couldn&rsquo;t, which also shouldn&rsquo;t be surprising. An example of this was asking it to plan a Hawaiian vacation for me. I figured planning a vacation was the kind of thing that GenAI could probably handle, there should be lots of examples of vacations that people enjoyed. It really, really wanted me to go see the Pearl Harbor memorial. (I did not.)</p>\n<p>Okay so that&rsquo;s all fine and good. Jump to today. I use ChatGPT at work, and Claude at home, and for my use cases, I think Claude is a lot better, but I wanted to talk a little bit about what I&rsquo;m actually using them for. What do I think they&rsquo;re good at?</p>\n<p>ChatGPT has proven itself quite adept at taking my stream of consciousness and making something other people could understand from it. If I start typing out the details of an email I would like to send, the important points, the audience, the tone, it will generate an email that&rsquo;s perfectly cromulent. Same with a Slack message. But also same with a Jira ticket. If I know basically what needs to happen and the order it needs to happen in, then Jira saves me the trouble of spending time formatting it into a proper set of acceptance criteria.</p>\n<p>Claude, with its Artifacts feature, has helped me develop and then fill out templates for data that I want to live inside my knowledge management system. I asked Claude for a template for a System of Systems document, and together we worked to refine it to have the detail level I wanted. Then I tossed it my list of systems, and it did a decent job of a first pass to fill it out.</p>\n<p>The recurring theme is that I&rsquo;ve found GenAI saves me from <em>typing</em> but not from <em>thinking</em>. Best case scenario it will prompt me with some questions that I might not have considered, but the important connection-making and organizational work is still happening in my brain. Given that, even as an unstructured stream of consciousness, the LLM can then enforce an order and produce an output that might be useful for someone else trying to understand what I thought. I don&rsquo;t really expect this to change, and once the hype cycle properly dies down I think we&rsquo;ll discover it&rsquo;s roughly the limit of what an LLM can do. It&rsquo;ll get better at doing it, but it can&rsquo;t really have an &ldquo;original&rdquo; thought.</p>\n<p>My question is how much money would you pay for the functionality I&rsquo;ve just described? Right now both ChatGPT and Claude have generous free tiers, but that&rsquo;s because their investors are expecting them to eat the world at some point, and, once eaten, for GenAI to have become so essential that people won&rsquo;t be able to remember how not to use it. They&rsquo;re building their captive audience today, and eventually that bill is going to come due.</p>\n<p>I suspect the true cost of this service is a lot more than I&rsquo;d be willing to pay to avoid typing an email, but time will tell. Maybe we&rsquo;ll find a way to make &ldquo;good enough&rdquo; LLMs operate affordably. We&rsquo;re still in the &ldquo;a computer takes up an entire room and only universities have them&rdquo; phase of this technology, and right now I have five different computers on my desk all of which are more capable than a mainframe was in 1982.</p>\n<p>I&rsquo;m also concerned about the environmental impact, in the sense that we burn a truly fantastic amount of electricity to provide this service. But I think that&rsquo;s more general than LLMs. We spend a truly fantastic amount of electricity to do lots of things, and are generally incapable as a society of building real solutions to that problem.</p>\n<p>Finally, I&rsquo;m concerned that OpenAI, Anthropic, and every other GenAI company out there had to basically steal all of the world&rsquo;s knowledge to build this thing. I mention this, because I think it&rsquo;s worth mentioning. Copyright infringement is apparently okay when Microsoft does it, but if the consumer pirates a copy of Windows now suddenly they care? I am not compelled by arguments about how hard it would be to solve this problem, nor how much it would cost. If we wanted to, we would. But I definitely think it&rsquo;s fair to consider this in your rubric for how seriously to respect the rights of corporations in turn.</p>\n<p>For now I continue to stand by my policy of no GenAI content on this blog. It would defeat entirely the purpose. I&rsquo;m not trying to impress anyone. I&rsquo;m barely even trying to convince anyone. These are my thoughts, filtered through my own artistic sense of the right words to use to convey them. 90% of the value is that I took the time to express them, and 10% is whatever value other people might derive from consuming them. But it would be a tactical error to continue to avoid GenAI indefinitely.

Anyone who tries to argue otherwise at this point probably sounds a lot like they're trying to argue the sky isn't blue or the moon isn't cheese.\n\nFor a little background, I first heard about GPT-2 back when it came out, a couple of years before ChatGPT hit the world stage, and some of the smartest nerds I know were marveling at the fact that you could get it to play chess competently. This was a surprising result, because LLMs use statistical techniques against words to predict outputs given an input. It shouldn't know what \"chess\" is, and it shouldn't be competent at the game.\n\nEarly ChatGPT didn't really impress me that much, and it routinely got stuff wrong. My best example of this would violate confidentiality, so consider that I'm not necessarily trying to convince you that old ChatGPT sucked. I think that should be obvious. Mostly I'm mentioning it to explain why I didn't even bother to start trying to use it or its competitors until much later.\n\nOnce Google announced Bard, I joined that bandwagon and made a few slight attempts to get it to do something useful. It mostly couldn't, which also shouldn't be surprising. An example of this was asking it to plan a Hawaiian vacation for me. I figured planning a vacation was the kind of thing that GenAI could probably handle, there should be lots of examples of vacations that people enjoyed. It really, really wanted me to go see the Pearl Harbor memorial. (I did not.)\n\nOkay so that's all fine and good. Jump to today. I use ChatGPT at work, and Claude at home, and for my use cases, I think Claude is a lot better, but I wanted to talk a little bit about what I'm actually using them for. What do I think they're good at?\n\nChatGPT has proven itself quite adept at taking my stream of consciousness and making something other people could understand from it. If I start typing out the details of an email I would like to send, the important points, the audience, the tone, it will generate an email that's perfectly cromulent. Same with a Slack message. But also same with a Jira ticket. If I know basically what needs to happen and the order it needs to happen in, then Jira saves me the trouble of spending time formatting it into a proper set of acceptance criteria.\n\nClaude, with its Artifacts feature, has helped me develop and then fill out templates for data that I want to live inside my knowledge management system. I asked Claude for a template for a System of Systems document, and together we worked to refine it to have the detail level I wanted. Then I tossed it my list of systems, and it did a decent job of a first pass to fill it out.\n\nThe recurring theme is that I've found GenAI saves me from *typing* but not from *thinking*. Best case scenario it will prompt me with some questions that I might not have considered, but the important connection-making and organizational work is still happening in my brain. Given that, even as an unstructured stream of consciousness, the LLM can then enforce an order and produce an output that might be useful for someone else trying to understand what I thought. I don't really expect this to change, and once the hype cycle properly dies down I think we'll discover it's roughly the limit of what an LLM can do. It'll get better at doing it, but it can't really have an \"original\" thought.\n\nMy question is how much money would you pay for the functionality I've just described? Right now both ChatGPT and Claude have generous free tiers, but that's because their investors are expecting them to eat the world at some point, and, once eaten, for GenAI to have become so essential that people won't be able to remember how not to use it. They're building their captive audience today, and eventually that bill is going to come due.\n\nI suspect the true cost of this service is a lot more than I'd be willing to pay to avoid typing an email, but time will tell. Maybe we'll find a way to make \"good enough\" LLMs operate affordably. We're still in the \"a computer takes up an entire room and only universities have them\" phase of this technology, and right now I have five different computers on my desk all of which are more capable than a mainframe was in 1982.\n\nI'm also concerned about the environmental impact, in the sense that we burn a truly fantastic amount of electricity to provide this service. But I think that's more general than LLMs. We spend a truly fantastic amount of electricity to do lots of things, and are generally incapable as a society of building real solutions to that problem.\n\nFinally, I'm concerned that OpenAI, Anthropic, and every other GenAI company out there had to basically steal all of the world's knowledge to build this thing. I mention this, because I think it's worth mentioning. Copyright infringement is apparently okay when Microsoft does it, but if the consumer pirates a copy of Windows now suddenly they care? I am not compelled by arguments about how hard it would be to solve this problem, nor how much it would cost. If we wanted to, we would. But I definitely think it's fair to consider this in your rubric for how seriously to respect the rights of corporations in turn.\n\nFor now I continue to stand by my policy of no GenAI content on this blog. It would defeat entirely the purpose. I'm not trying to impress anyone. I'm barely even trying to convince anyone. These are my thoughts, filtered through my own artistic sense of the right words to use to convey them. 90% of the value is that I took the time to express them, and 10% is whatever value other people might derive from consuming them. But it would be a tactical error to continue to avoid GenAI indefinitely. If you're not engaging with it currently I'd strongly recommend thinking about where it might be able to help you; the answer is almost certainly not \"nowhere.\"\n",

I even had a couple of those <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Dash\">little IoT buttons</a> that could automatically order products inside a cabinet cupboard. I think I used one to order breath mints once.</p>\n<p>Of all the things they have done and still do, there’s only one consumer level service from Amazon that I miss: my kindle.</p>\n<p>Amazon got the experience of using the kindle extremely right. The page turn is fast and satisfying, the distractions are few, books load quickly. Except for the fact that Amazon makes it, it&rsquo;s the perfect device. So of course the baby must go out the window with the bathwater. It wouldn&rsquo;t be acceptable to say &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t shop on Amazon&hellip; Except for this one way in which I do.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>In case it&rsquo;s not abundantly clear, I take disproportionate amounts of psychic damage from small inconveniences. Maybe Steve Jobs and I <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2011/11/14/the-tweaker\">would have gotten along</a>, because even the most trivial of ways in which a product can get something wrong will absolutely ruin it for me. Which is why I&rsquo;ve never quite found my stride using an iPad mini to replace my kindle. Oh it&rsquo;s a fine device. I&rsquo;d probably even recommend it. But I don&rsquo;t use it to read very many books, for about seventeen smallish reasons.</p>\n<p>All of which is to say I think it might be time to reevaluate the eReader ecosystem.</p>\n<p>By which I mean I already did that. Because there&rsquo;s really only a handful of players, the kindle is still dominant, and they all suck in one way or another.</p>\n<p>But I think there&rsquo;s a path forward with <a href=\"https://us.kobobooks.com/collections/ereaders/products/kobo-libra-colour\">Kobo</a>. It appears to have the best support for sideloaded books, and for a variety of reasons that&rsquo;s the way I need to be able to get my books on to a device. It also has the best support for getting my highlights back off through the stack of services I prefer using.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, they&rsquo;ve spent a lot of effort on their new pen ecosystem which looks cool but doesn&rsquo;t really seem to have a good export story. It doesn&rsquo;t help me to be able to &ldquo;draw&rdquo; on a digital book if that drawing is trapped forever on the kobo&rsquo;s screen. Sorry, Rakuten, this ain&rsquo;t that.</p>\n<p>All other things being equal I&rsquo;d rather have a device that does one thing extremely well, and then carry as many such devices as needed.

				"content_text": "I might be the only person you know who doesn't shop on Amazon.\n\n<!--more-->\n\nThat’s not to say I never did. I had prime, many years ago. I even had a couple of those [little IoT buttons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Dash) that could automatically order products inside a cabinet cupboard. I think I used one to order breath mints once.\n\nOf all the things they have done and still do, there’s only one consumer level service from Amazon that I miss: my kindle.\n\nAmazon got the experience of using the kindle extremely right. The page turn is fast and satisfying, the distractions are few, books load quickly. Except for the fact that Amazon makes it, it's the perfect device. So of course the baby must go out the window with the bathwater. It wouldn't be acceptable to say \"I don't shop on Amazon... Except for this one way in which I do.\"\n\nIn case it's not abundantly clear, I take disproportionate amounts of psychic damage from small inconveniences. Maybe Steve Jobs and I [would have gotten along](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2011/11/14/the-tweaker), because even the most trivial of ways in which a product can get something wrong will absolutely ruin it for me. Which is why I've never quite found my stride using an iPad mini to replace my kindle. Oh it's a fine device. I'd probably even recommend it. But I don't use it to read very many books, for about seventeen smallish reasons.\n\nAll of which is to say I think it might be time to reevaluate the eReader ecosystem.\n\nBy which I mean I already did that. Because there's really only a handful of players, the kindle is still dominant, and they all suck in one way or another.\n\nBut I think there's a path forward with [Kobo](https://us.kobobooks.com/collections/ereaders/products/kobo-libra-colour). It appears to have the best support for sideloaded books, and for a variety of reasons that's the way I need to be able to get my books on to a device. It also has the best support for getting my highlights back off through the stack of services I prefer using.\n\nUnfortunately, they've spent a lot of effort on their new pen ecosystem which looks cool but doesn't really seem to have a good export story. It doesn't help me to be able to \"draw\" on a digital book if that drawing is trapped forever on the kobo's screen. Sorry, Rakuten, this ain't that.\n\nAll other things being equal I'd rather have a device that does one thing extremely well, and then carry as many such devices as needed. Almost nobody builds those devices anymore, there's no path to hockey stick unicorn trajectory golden parachute baked brie on rye simply being the best at solving a real problem these days. Also it needs AI. Sprinkle some AI on it. [Bitches love AI](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/bitches-love-smiley-faces).\n\nWhich means, realistically, a device that's competent at the thing I care about, and then does a bunch of other stuff I don't.

You do not know how much I value the thing, but you will find out repeatedly I value it more than you. And if I value it so highly, well, shouldn't you? And why shouldn't you have the Trashthing? It would look so very prim next to your collection of Whozits and Whatsits Galore. Thingamabobs? You've got twenty. But who cares, no big deal. You want more.\n\nAnd that's when things get meta. You know that I know this, but do I know that you know this? So what if, instead of the most I'd be willing to pay, I put half? Then I can find out where the set point is. Maybe I'm now the winner, maybe I'm not. In either case I have new information. And if you come along and nickel-and-dime me out of the winning position, I have no incentive to fight you. All I'll do is drive the price up early. I have the signal I needed. At which point the winning strategy is always, always, to wait until as close to auction close as practical to swoop in with my true highest bid, in the hopes that you will be too busy in the real world to notice, and will have done something very similar, resulting in a \"maximum bid\" below your true bid.\n\nThen, in approximately six hours, I discover if I've won yet another MiniDisc player.\n",

The problem isn&rsquo;t that they think it&rsquo;s better than you do, it&rsquo;s that they think that mediocrity deserves a 90%+ score.</p>\n<p>Again, it seems to me this is primarily an American thing.</p>\n<p>Maybe it&rsquo;s because I see absolutely no value in maintaining the status quo where it doesn&rsquo;t make any sense to me, I&rsquo;ve never used this style of rating. Usually that means I need to publish a rubric.</p>\n<p>For example, here&rsquo;s my rubric for recipes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>1 star: not good as-is, could be redeemed. Research and try again.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>2 star: one person liked this, but not both.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>3 star: we both liked this and would like to have it again.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>4 star: very good, should make once per month.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>5 star: the very best, should make every week.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Three stars is a perfectly fine recipe that we both liked. There&rsquo;s literally nothing wrong with it.</p>\n<h2 id=\"okay-but-so-why\">Okay, but, so&hellip; Why?</h2>\n<p>I&rsquo;m in the process of setting up <a href=\"https://rpggeek.com/\">RPGGeek</a> as the place to track my project of reviewing all these RPG books. They inherited a 10-star rating system from BoardGameGeek. I think it&rsquo;s awful, that&rsquo;s far too many stars, but the communities on that site have done a surprisingly good job of fighting back against rating inflation. The absolutely highest-rated board game has achieved an average rating of 8.60 with almost 50k votes.</p>\n<p>But still, I disagree a bit with their published rubric. It&rsquo;s better than most, but I think still trends towards assuming that something basically okay should have a score of 6.</p>\n<p>For RPG items, they publish this:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>10 - Outstanding. Rules and concepts well presented and a near perfect fit to your play style. Excellent writing. Excellent Editing. Highly consistent throughout. You would highly recommend this book/product.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>9 - Excellent. Same as 10 but lacking in one or more of the elements (writing style, editing, consistency).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>8 - Very Good. Rules and concepts are a good fit to your play style with some reservations. Solid writing. Solid Editing. Highly consistent throughout.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>7 - Good. Same as 8 but lacking in one of the elements (writing style, editing, consistency).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>6 - Above Average. Rules and concepts are a reasonable fit to your play style but there are significant sections which you would change or not use in actual play. Solid writing. Solid Editing. Highly consistent throughout.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>5 - Average. Same as 6 but lacking in one of the elements (writing style, editing, consistency).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>4 - Below Average. Rules and concepts are not a great fit to your play style and there are significant sections which you would change or not use in actual play. You would cherry pick a few ideas from such a book and discard the rest. Solid writing. Solid Editing. Highly consistent throughout.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>3 - Well Below Average. Same as 4 but lacking in one of the elements (writing style, editing, consistency).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>2 - Poor. Rules and concepts are not likely to mesh at all with your play style and there are precious few things you can cull from this book to use in your actual play. Solid writing. Solid Editing. Highly consistent throughout.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>1 - Horrible. Same as 2 but lacking in one of the elements (writing style, editing, consistency).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It&rsquo;s more thought than I see most sites giving the problem, but I want to propose an alternative.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>5 - Average. You would play this game. There is nothing particularly good nor bad about it. It&rsquo;s fine.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Okay, what moves us up the scale from a 5? I can think of three areas of analysis: mythos, production, mechanics.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Mythos</strong> - How interesting is the game&rsquo;s world? How evocative is the writing? Am I excited about the stories it wants to tell?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Production</strong> - How well-produced is the book? Art, writing, graphic design. How do the materials feel? Is this an object of beauty?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Mechanics</strong> - How playable is the game? Does it provide systems that are fun to engage with? How portable are those systems?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So let&rsquo;s pin a perfect 10 in our scale.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>10 - Outstanding. The world is vibrant and interesting, the stories are evocative. The item is finely produced and would be worthy of display. It is an art object in and of itself. The mechanics are interesting, clearly presented, and weave together to support the stories of the mythos.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And with that, I think we can pin a 1.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>1 - Horrible. This item has no redeeming qualities. The stories are not interesting, the world lacks color and flavor. The item itself is utilitarian and otherwise poorly produced. You would not want people to see it on your bookshelf. The mechanics offer nothing new or interesting.

But I don&rsquo;t get to set the system on RPGGeek. One option is to map my system on to theirs.

About halfway through I thought &ldquo;this should be a blog post.&rdquo; So&hellip;</p>\n<h2 id=\"everything\">EVERYTHING</h2>\n<p>Like my mother before me, I&rsquo;m a type 2 diabetic. I have tried just about every common intervention known to humankind. If it exists, and a doctor knows how to prescribe it, I&rsquo;ve probably taken it.</p>\n<p>The most successful intervention I ever discovered was a combination of intermittent fasting, long fasts, and &ldquo;not really keto but sort of basically keto.&rdquo; I had an 8-hour daily eating window, occasional fasts that ranged all the way up to a week, and cutting the added sugar from just about everything but not going wholesale anti-carb.</p>\n<p>I lost a truly fantastic amount of weight, was able to stop all my diabetes-related medications, and was generally the healthiest I&rsquo;ve been as an adult.</p>\n<p>Despite hitting my lowest adult weight and the general level of my success, I was not at a weight my doctor considered ideal, and so he encouraged me to try semaglutide. I&rsquo;m not here to throw him under a bus, I think I have a pretty good doctor and he&rsquo;s been thoughtful and supportive all along. However, the promise of not having to work quite so hard to maintain this house of cards lead my entire non-pharmaceutical intervention strategy to crumble. And I mean, really crumble. Roman empire level of collapse.</p>\n<p>Semaglutide didn&rsquo;t work for me. I mean it did, sort of technically, but not in the way one would want it to. I gained weight the entire time I was on it, but slower than I would have if I were left to my own devices. It had an effect, just not enough of one. Slowly, over the course of about a year, I regained all of the weight I lost. A new job during the time period and its associated stresses couldn&rsquo;t have helped.</p>\n<h2 id=\"everywhere\">EVERYWHERE</h2>\n<p>Around December of this year we decided to try switching me from semaglutide to tirzepatide. I know lots of people who&rsquo;ve had truly amazing results on tirzepatide. My insurance company did what insurance companies do. They couldn&rsquo;t outright deny the prior-authorization. I fully qualify by their own standards. So they wrapped me up in so much paperwork trying to prove it that I decided fasting would be easier. Congratulations American healthcare system, you won.</p>\n<p>Late March I decided to try a new fasting protocol that I had encountered called rolling fasts. Roughly 90 hours of fasting followed by a &ldquo;re-feed&rdquo; meal, followed by a new fast. This actually works great for me, for many reasons, and I think I probably won&rsquo;t go into all of them.</p>\n<p>Shortly after I started I had some concerning symptoms that I will spare you the details of. It was enough to be concerned maybe the fasting wasn&rsquo;t safe. A couple months of fits and starts and diagnosis, we figured out it was unrelated and the problem passed. Ever since, I&rsquo;ve been happily maintaining a rolling fast without significant issue.</p>\n<p>One of the things I like about rolling fasts is that I only eat once every four days, and that means I&rsquo;m rarely needing to figure out dinner at the last minute, which leads to making much better decisions about what to eat. And I&rsquo;m not saying perfectly healthy by any stretch of the imagination. But I am saying that I never run out to Taco Bell right after work because I forgot to buy groceries and accidentally falling mouth-first into a pile of spicy potato tacos.</p>\n<p>I get a few days to really figure out what I&rsquo;m craving, and then whatever it is I get to go have it. Honestly? It&rsquo;s the healthiest emotional relationship with food I&rsquo;ve ever had.</p>\n<h2 id=\"all-at-once\">ALL AT ONCE</h2>\n<p>Yesterday was my mid-year blood draw, and the results for my blood sugar aren&rsquo;t exactly grim, but they&rsquo;re not where I&rsquo;d want them to be. This has prompted some introspection. The main problem as I currently see it is that I don&rsquo;t have a good and reliable way to monitor my blood sugar during the fast and re-feed. And that&rsquo;s how we get to the topic of CGMs.</p>\n<p>I don&rsquo;t mind a finger poke, but I think that method is highly susceptible to the games one can play with when they choose to check. Before a meal, fully fasted? Great! Perfect numbers! An hour after the only meal I&rsquo;ll have that week? High! But for how long? Who knows! My sense of blood sugar is that one of the things that really matters is how long it takes to come back down to a normal level after eating, and that&rsquo;s the kind of data one really only gets through a CGM. It matters a bit how high it spikes, but I&rsquo;m mostly not eating cake for dinner. What really matters is if I&rsquo;m spending the first two days of a four day fast just waiting for my blood sugar to come back down to a fasted state.</p>\n<p>So I think I need to get back on a CGM, which I plan to talk to my doctor about at our next appointment. But I&rsquo;d like to try some of the other options that aren&rsquo;t the Libre 2, which as I mentioned, I hate. Loathe. Despise entirely. Some searching indicates the Libre 3 might not have any of the key problems that frustrated me, and the Dexcom Stelo is supposed to be coming sometime this summer.</p>\n<p>The important thing from my perspective is to find a source of reliable data from which to act. I can&rsquo;t diagnose the machine if none of the sensors are working.</p>",

However, the promise of not having to work quite so hard to maintain this house of cards lead my entire non-pharmaceutical intervention strategy to crumble. And I mean, really crumble. Roman empire level of collapse.\n\nSemaglutide didn't work for me. I mean it did, sort of technically, but not in the way one would want it to. I gained weight the entire time I was on it, but slower than I would have if I were left to my own devices. It had an effect, just not enough of one. Slowly, over the course of about a year, I regained all of the weight I lost. A new job during the time period and its associated stresses couldn't have helped.\n\n## EVERYWHERE\n\nAround December of this year we decided to try switching me from semaglutide to tirzepatide. I know lots of people who've had truly amazing results on tirzepatide. My insurance company did what insurance companies do. They couldn't outright deny the prior-authorization. I fully qualify by their own standards. So they wrapped me up in so much paperwork trying to prove it that I decided fasting would be easier. Congratulations American healthcare system, you won.\n\nLate March I decided to try a new fasting protocol that I had encountered called rolling fasts. Roughly 90 hours of fasting followed by a \"re-feed\" meal, followed by a new fast. This actually works great for me, for many reasons, and I think I probably won't go into all of them.\n\nShortly after I started I had some concerning symptoms that I will spare you the details of. It was enough to be concerned maybe the fasting wasn't safe. A couple months of fits and starts and diagnosis, we figured out it was unrelated and the problem passed. Ever since, I've been happily maintaining a rolling fast without significant issue.\n\nOne of the things I like about rolling fasts is that I only eat once every four days, and that means I'm rarely needing to figure out dinner at the last minute, which leads to making much better decisions about what to eat. And I'm not saying perfectly healthy by any stretch of the imagination. But I am saying that I never run out to Taco Bell right after work because I forgot to buy groceries and accidentally falling mouth-first into a pile of spicy potato tacos.\n\nI get a few days to really figure out what I'm craving, and then whatever it is I get to go have it. Honestly? It's the healthiest emotional relationship with food I've ever had.\n\n## ALL AT ONCE\n\nYesterday was my mid-year blood draw, and the results for my blood sugar aren't exactly grim, but they're not where I'd want them to be. This has prompted some introspection. The main problem as I currently see it is that I don't have a good and reliable way to monitor my blood sugar during the fast and re-feed. And that's how we get to the topic of CGMs.\n\nI don't mind a finger poke, but I think that method is highly susceptible to the games one can play with when they choose to check. Before a meal, fully fasted? Great! Perfect numbers! An hour after the only meal I'll have that week? High! But for how long? Who knows! My sense of blood sugar is that one of the things that really matters is how long it takes to come back down to a normal level after eating, and that's the kind of data one really only gets through a CGM. It matters a bit how high it spikes, but I'm mostly not eating cake for dinner. What really matters is if I'm spending the first two days of a four day fast just waiting for my blood sugar to come back down to a fasted state.\n\nSo I think I need to get back on a CGM, which I plan to talk to my doctor about at our next appointment. But I'd like to try some of the other options that aren't the Libre 2, which as I mentioned, I hate. Loathe. Despise entirely. Some searching indicates the Libre 3 might not have any of the key problems that frustrated me, and the Dexcom Stelo is supposed to be coming sometime this summer.\n\nThe important thing from my perspective is to find a source of reliable data from which to act. I can't diagnose the machine if none of the sensors are working.\n",

It uses a balance wheel, which is a particularly fragile and difficult-to-adjust mechanism, so I haven't taken it down and tried to fix that yet.\n\nThe grandfather clock is out for repairs [with a professional](https://theoldfashionway.com/). Again. He thinks he's found the source of the problem, and intends to publish a youtube video about it. I think it's probably a good (or bad) sign when someone has to post a video about a new and interesting way that a clock can break. (It was magnets.)\n\n### MiniDisc\nSince he was here to collect all the parts of the grandfather clock, I asked the clock guy (who also does radio repairs,) if he wanted to take a swing at [one of my MiniDisc players](https://www.minidisc.wiki/equipment/sony/portable/mz-e3).

This is ground truth. Some people \"believe\" otherwise. Beliefs are derived from ground truth, but they do not influence ground truth.

The kind someone else might have created in high school and stuck with for the next 20 years. I was looking for something that could represent me, wasn&rsquo;t already taken everywhere, and wasn&rsquo;t directly associated with my day job or anything I&rsquo;ve done previously on the internet. Not entirely sure how I stumbled on the word, but &ldquo;<a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/contrariwise\">Contrariwise</a>&rdquo; was an instant hit among friends.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Please tell us the site name and its origin.</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I think I found TheWizardly through one of those &ldquo;help me think up a domain name&rdquo; services. It was around the time that the &ldquo;wizard ponders orb&rdquo; meme was going around, which I loved, and it was the driving force behind presenting myself as a random internet wizard.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>If you don&rsquo;t mind, please tell me your date of birth.</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I do mind.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>What does the site deal with?</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Whatever I&rsquo;m thinking about at the moment. I have a bad habit of responding to simple questions with an essay. Sometimes I think it makes sense to just publish the essay instead. I use my blog as something like the intersection between what very small amount of value I used to get out of Twitter, while also still being able to get lengthy when I want to. My experience is that people are busy and they mostly don&rsquo;t click links, so posting links to a blog from a microblog is a great way to make sure your blog never gets read. Having one stream that does both is, I think, the best I can get while still being respectful of other peoples' time and attention.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Please tell us your recommended content.</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<p>There&rsquo;s not much of a backlog to look at currently, but if you don&rsquo;t know me you might enjoy <a href=\"https://thewizardly.com/now/\">thewizardly.com/now/</a> which is perpetually out of date, but I think a rather good snapshot of my interests. If you also like some of those things, you might like my posts in general.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Is the content you are working on a hobby? Are you an aspiring professional (or already a professional)?</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Let&rsquo;s call it a hobby? I try to keep work entirely out of this stream. It&rsquo;d be neat to make some money doing some of my hobbies someday, but I&rsquo;m also not trying to turn any of them into &ldquo;jobbies.&rdquo;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Do you have any off-duty activities related to the content you are handling?</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<p>(In the context of Japanese society this question is asking if I do things like vend at conventions related to my hobbies.) Short answer? No.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Please let us know if there are any people or works that you are aiming for in the content you are handling.</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<p>(In situ this question is basically asking if I&rsquo;m aspiring to emulate anyone.) No. I&rsquo;m striving for authenticity. Not, like, &ldquo;branded authenticity.&rdquo; Actually just my real answers, thoughts, and perspectives. One of the reasons why I want to detach this identity from &ldquo;real me&rdquo; is that it allows me to be more real in every way that matters. The day job requires a brand. It requires emulation. This is more &ldquo;me&rdquo; than most people who ever meet me are likely to get.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Do you have a set update frequency and update time for your site?</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I&rsquo;m trying to post roughly weekly, just to build and maintain the habit. I don&rsquo;t kick myself too hard if it I miss it.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>For what maximum period have you stopped updating?</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Since starting this blog, I think at most a couple of weeks. However I&rsquo;ve gone &ldquo;radio silent&rdquo; on the internet for periods of years in other places.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Would you like to get more visitors?</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Yes, but only inasmuch as I always want to attract more of my tribe. I want more visitors who are legitimately interested in the kinds of things I talk about.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Are you happy with the feedback on the content?</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I&rsquo;m happy with all positive, constructive feedback. Reasonable people should be able to disagree about some things, and I&rsquo;m not particularly interested in the kind of vitriol that&rsquo;s standard in other parts of the internet. It&rsquo;s like we forgot, culturally, that it was possible to walk away and not say anything.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>What do you think about typos and broken links?</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<p>When I notice them, I fix them, but mistakes are the touch of a human&rsquo;s hand. I fear the world where no mistake is permitted far more than someone judging my typo.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Do you accept requests?</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I think this is probably intended for someone who has an artistic output. My artistic output is primarily words. I think I&rsquo;d take a suggestion on a topic to write about, if I thought I had anything to say, but I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;d take commissioned writing work.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Are there hidden pages?</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Not intentionally! I think I might have toyed around with some plugins on my host that are still technically enabled, but I haven&rsquo;t hidden anything with the intent of it being found.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Do you have another site?</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Several! All defunct. Haven&rsquo;t figured out what to do about that.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Do you allow links? If so, please let me know if there are any conditions.</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Certainly. I would prefer if links stay within the <a href=\"https://indieweb.org/\">IndieWeb</a>. I won&rsquo;t be entirely crushed if I end up linked somewhere out on the Commercial Web, if the end result of that is meeting more of my tribe.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Did you have any experience running another site before starting this one?</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I&rsquo;ve been running sites since the days of Geocities and Angelfire. It&rsquo;s probably for the best that I couldn&rsquo;t remember where any of those were, though. No idea if I&rsquo;m in <a href=\"https://archive.org/web/geocities.php\">the big Geocities dump</a>. Probably?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>What inspired you to create this site?</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I needed a place to be able to get thoughts out of my head but which also would allow me to interact with the <a href=\"https://indieweb.org/\">IndieWeb</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fediverse\">Fediverse</a>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>When was this site established?</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<p>2023/10/31.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Do you have any celebration plans for the opening anniversary?</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I don&rsquo;t think so! I probably won&rsquo;t even make note of it, if I notice.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Do you keep in mind events such as Halloween and Christmas, seasonal changes, and social trends when updating?</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Not even a little bit. Honestly I sometimes forget to keep those things in mind in day to day life.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Do you use SNS?</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<p>(&ldquo;SNS&rdquo; is the shorthand term that the Japanese use for &ldquo;social media&rdquo;.) Basically, no. The closest I get is this blog&rsquo;s federation to the Fediverse. You can follow me on Mastodon! I have an account on BlueSky that just reposts everything I post here, to make it easier for people to follow me there until they get <a href=\"https://atproto.com/guides/overview\">ATProtocol</a> fully up and working.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Please tell us why you dare to run a website in this SNS era.</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Because the slow web was a better web. And the small web still is, where it exists and you can find it. Computers are a miracle. We taught sand to think by hitting it with lightning. But that doesn&rsquo;t mean every invention that followed was a net positive for society. I don&rsquo;t think social media actually helps anyone, and I think I&rsquo;d have a pretty high burden of proof to change that prior.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Is there anything you keep in mind when running your site?</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Be honest. Be clear. Be kind. Nobody&rsquo;s ever changed their mind because someone yelled at them.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Is there anything that remains in your mind while running the site?</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I have a set of principals for engaging with the internet. I&rsquo;ve never written them down. I probably should. It includes not having any kind of intentional tracking on this site. It might be kind of neat to know how many people see it, but I can&rsquo;t preach with one hand that people shouldn&rsquo;t be tracked and then track them. I know that there are services that do a more respectful version of tracking, but I think the correct amount is none. For me and also for everyone else. We should not have opened this pandora&rsquo;s box.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Do you have any problems with site management?</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<p>No, I pay <a href=\"https://micro.blog/\">micro.blog</a> to do all the hard stuff for me.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Do you ever get embarrassed about content you posted a long time ago and delete it?</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t say I&rsquo;m embarrassed. There&rsquo;s definitely stuff I posted when I was young that is, how they say, &ldquo;cringe&rdquo; by modern standards. It&rsquo;s probably cached in Google and the Wayback machine, if you knew where to look, but I don&rsquo;t. I have never once, in my life, tried to search myself on Google. I think it&rsquo;s probably the correct position, and I&rsquo;d recommend it to everyone.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Have you ever thought about quitting the site?</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Not this one, but I&rsquo;ve basically &ldquo;quit&rdquo; others when they stopped making sense. Some of which were lost forever, which is a shame.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Do you have backups or other measures in place in case your site suddenly disappears?</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Not yet. I&rsquo;m not invested enough that I think it would be a catatrophe. At some point I know I&rsquo;ll need to set up some kind of archival solution for this site.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>If you were to die tomorrow, would you leave your website behind? Do you want to delete it?</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I think I&rsquo;d want to leave it. I suspect there are people that would come here, read what I typed, and they&rsquo;d hear it in my voice. And for a short period of time I&rsquo;d still be there. I think a piece of us lives on as long as we&rsquo;re still remembered and thought of. It would be real cool to be the kind of person that people think of long after I&rsquo;m gone.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Are you okay if your family or real-life friends and acquaintances see your site?</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<p>That&rsquo;s probably 90% of who&rsquo;s seeing it.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>How much of a difference do you think there is between your online image and your real-life personality?</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Less than you&rsquo;d imagine. Authenticity is part of the goal. The only place I&rsquo;m anything other than exactly who I am is work.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>What kind of people do you want to visit your site?</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Interesting weirdos. Kind people with strong opinions about making the world a better place and realistic plans for achieving it.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Are you registered for searches or rankings?</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I think I applied to be listed in an IndieWeb / Personal Blog list, but I never followed up and I have no idea if that ever happened. I could probably get listed on Google but I think it&rsquo;s pretty unlikely I&rsquo;d ever rank on any searches so it&rsquo;s not high up my list.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Are you part of an alliance?</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<p>(This is the Japanese equivalent of a webring.) No. I don&rsquo;t actually know how much those ever worked, if I&rsquo;m being honest. Someone out there probably used them a lot, but I didn&rsquo;t. Maybe if I found one that really seemed align with my kind of weirdo I&rsquo;d get hooked up, but I&rsquo;m not actively seeking that out.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Please tell me the service or server you are using.</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I&rsquo;m gladly hosted on <a href=\"https://micro.blog/\">micro.blog</a>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Why did you choose that service or server?</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<p>They do everything I think I need, at a completely reasonable price.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Do you use templates?</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The site layout is a template through <a href=\"https://micro.blog/\">micro.blog</a>. I don&rsquo;t use any templates in my post content. I&rsquo;ve thought about it, for something like a weekly review post. Maybe I will at some point.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>How well do you know the languages used to create homepages, such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP?</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I&rsquo;m fluent in all of those things, but prefer not to do it. I haven&rsquo;t written a line of PHP since probably 2006?

				"content_text": "### 個人サイト管理人に50の質問\n#### 50 Questions for Personal Site Administrators\n###### Shamelessly borrowed from [bikobatanari.art/posts/202...](https://bikobatanari.art/posts/2023/50-questions) who also provides context on where this trend originated.\n\n- **Please tell us your name and its origin.**\n> A couple of years ago I was trying to come up with a username. The kind someone else might have created in high school and stuck with for the next 20 years. I was looking for something that could represent me, wasn't already taken everywhere, and wasn't directly associated with my day job or anything I've done previously on the internet. Not entirely sure how I stumbled on the word, but \"[Contrariwise](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/contrariwise)\" was an instant hit among friends.\n\n- **Please tell us the site name and its origin.**\n> I think I found TheWizardly through one of those \"help me think up a domain name\" services. It was around the time that the \"wizard ponders orb\" meme was going around, which I loved, and it was the driving force behind presenting myself as a random internet wizard.\n\n- **If you don't mind, please tell me your date of birth.**\n> I do mind.\n\n- **What does the site deal with?**\n> Whatever I'm thinking about at the moment. I have a bad habit of responding to simple questions with an essay. Sometimes I think it makes sense to just publish the essay instead. I use my blog as something like the intersection between what very small amount of value I used to get out of Twitter, while also still being able to get lengthy when I want to. My experience is that people are busy and they mostly don't click links, so posting links to a blog from a microblog is a great way to make sure your blog never gets read. Having one stream that does both is, I think, the best I can get while still being respectful of other peoples' time and attention.\n\n- **Please tell us your recommended content.**\n> There's not much of a backlog to look at currently, but if you don't know me you might enjoy [thewizardly.com/now/](https://thewizardly.com/now/) which is perpetually out of date, but I think a rather good snapshot of my interests. If you also like some of those things, you might like my posts in general.\n\n- **Is the content you are working on a hobby? Are you an aspiring professional (or already a professional)?**\n> Let's call it a hobby? I try to keep work entirely out of this stream. It'd be neat to make some money doing some of my hobbies someday, but I'm also not trying to turn any of them into \"jobbies.\"\n\n- **Do you have any off-duty activities related to the content you are handling?**\n> (In the context of Japanese society this question is asking if I do things like vend at conventions related to my hobbies.) Short answer? No.\n\n- **Please let us know if there are any people or works that you are aiming for in the content you are handling.**\n> (In situ this question is basically asking if I'm aspiring to emulate anyone.) No. I'm striving for authenticity. Not, like, \"branded authenticity.\" Actually just my real answers, thoughts, and perspectives. One of the reasons why I want to detach this identity from \"real me\" is that it allows me to be more real in every way that matters. The day job requires a brand. It requires emulation. This is more \"me\" than most people who ever meet me are likely to get.\n\n- **Do you have a set update frequency and update time for your site?**\n> I'm trying to post roughly weekly, just to build and maintain the habit. I don't kick myself too hard if it I miss it.\n\n- **For what maximum period have you stopped updating?**\n> Since starting this blog, I think at most a couple of weeks. However I've gone \"radio silent\" on the internet for periods of years in other places.\n\n- **Would you like to get more visitors?**\n> Yes, but only inasmuch as I always want to attract more of my tribe. I want more visitors who are legitimately interested in the kinds of things I talk about.\n\n- **Are you happy with the feedback on the content?**\n> I'm happy with all positive, constructive feedback. Reasonable people should be able to disagree about some things, and I'm not particularly interested in the kind of vitriol that's standard in other parts of the internet. It's like we forgot, culturally, that it was possible to walk away and not say anything.\n\n- **What do you think about typos and broken links?**\n> When I notice them, I fix them, but mistakes are the touch of a human's hand. I fear the world where no mistake is permitted far more than someone judging my typo.\n\n- **Do you accept requests?**\n> I think this is probably intended for someone who has an artistic output. My artistic output is primarily words. I think I'd take a suggestion on a topic to write about, if I thought I had anything to say, but I don't think I'd take commissioned writing work.\n\n- **Are there hidden pages?**\n> Not intentionally! I think I might have toyed around with some plugins on my host that are still technically enabled, but I haven't hidden anything with the intent of it being found.\n\n- **Do you have another site?**\n> Several! All defunct. Haven't figured out what to do about that.\n\n- **Do you allow links? If so, please let me know if there are any conditions.**\n> Certainly. I would prefer if links stay within the [IndieWeb](https://indieweb.org/). I won't be entirely crushed if I end up linked somewhere out on the Commercial Web, if the end result of that is meeting more of my tribe.\n\n- **Did you have any experience running another site before starting this one?**\n> I've been running sites since the days of Geocities and Angelfire. It's probably for the best that I couldn't remember where any of those were, though. No idea if I'm in [the big Geocities dump](https://archive.org/web/geocities.php). Probably?\n\n- **What inspired you to create this site?**\n> I needed a place to be able to get thoughts out of my head but which also would allow me to interact with the [IndieWeb](https://indieweb.org/) and [Fediverse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fediverse).\n\n- **When was this site established?**\n> 2023/10/31.\n\n- **Do you have any celebration plans for the opening anniversary?** \n> I don't think so! I probably won't even make note of it, if I notice.\n\n- **Do you keep in mind events such as Halloween and Christmas, seasonal changes, and social trends when updating?**\n> Not even a little bit. Honestly I sometimes forget to keep those things in mind in day to day life.\n\n- **Do you use SNS?**\n> (\"SNS\" is the shorthand term that the Japanese use for \"social media\".) Basically, no. The closest I get is this blog's federation to the Fediverse. You can follow me on Mastodon! I have an account on BlueSky that just reposts everything I post here, to make it easier for people to follow me there until they get [ATProtocol](https://atproto.com/guides/overview) fully up and working.\n\n- **Please tell us why you dare to run a website in this SNS era.**\n> Because the slow web was a better web. And the small web still is, where it exists and you can find it. Computers are a miracle. We taught sand to think by hitting it with lightning. But that doesn't mean every invention that followed was a net positive for society. I don't think social media actually helps anyone, and I think I'd have a pretty high burden of proof to change that prior.\n\n- **Is there anything you keep in mind when running your site?**\n> Be honest. Be clear. Be kind. Nobody's ever changed their mind because someone yelled at them.\n\n- **Is there anything that remains in your mind while running the site?**\n> I have a set of principals for engaging with the internet. I've never written them down. I probably should. It includes not having any kind of intentional tracking on this site. It might be kind of neat to know how many people see it, but I can't preach with one hand that people shouldn't be tracked and then track them. I know that there are services that do a more respectful version of tracking, but I think the correct amount is none. For me and also for everyone else. We should not have opened this pandora's box.\n\n- **Do you have any problems with site management?**\n> No, I pay [micro.blog](https://micro.blog/) to do all the hard stuff for me.\n\n- **Do you ever get embarrassed about content you posted a long time ago and delete it?**\n> I wouldn't say I'm embarrassed. There's definitely stuff I posted when I was young that is, how they say, \"cringe\" by modern standards. It's probably cached in Google and the Wayback machine, if you knew where to look, but I don't. I have never once, in my life, tried to search myself on Google. I think it's probably the correct position, and I'd recommend it to everyone.\n\n\n- **Have you ever thought about quitting the site?**\n> Not this one, but I've basically \"quit\" others when they stopped making sense. Some of which were lost forever, which is a shame.\n\n- **Do you have backups or other measures in place in case your site suddenly disappears?**\n> Not yet. I'm not invested enough that I think it would be a catatrophe. At some point I know I'll need to set up some kind of archival solution for this site.\n\n- **If you were to die tomorrow, would you leave your website behind? Do you want to delete it?**\n> I think I'd want to leave it. I suspect there are people that would come here, read what I typed, and they'd hear it in my voice. And for a short period of time I'd still be there. I think a piece of us lives on as long as we're still remembered and thought of. It would be real cool to be the kind of person that people think of long after I'm gone.\n\n- **Are you okay if your family or real-life friends and acquaintances see your site?**\n> That's probably 90% of who's seeing it.\n\n- **How much of a difference do you think there is between your online image and your real-life personality?**\n> Less than you'd imagine. Authenticity is part of the goal. The only place I'm anything other than exactly who I am is work.\n\n- **What kind of people do you want to visit your site?**\n> Interesting weirdos. Kind people with strong opinions about making the world a better place and realistic plans for achieving it.\n\n- **Are you registered for searches or rankings?**\n> I think I applied to be listed in an IndieWeb / Personal Blog list, but I never followed up and I have no idea if that ever happened. I could probably get listed on Google but I think it's pretty unlikely I'd ever rank on any searches so it's not high up my list.\n\n- **Are you part of an alliance?**\n> (This is the Japanese equivalent of a webring.) No. I don't actually know how much those ever worked, if I'm being honest. Someone out there probably used them a lot, but I didn't. Maybe if I found one that really seemed align with my kind of weirdo I'd get hooked up, but I'm not actively seeking that out.\n\n- **Please tell me the service or server you are using.**\n> I'm gladly hosted on [micro.blog](https://micro.blog/).\n\n- **Why did you choose that service or server?**\n> They do everything I think I need, at a completely reasonable price.\n\n- **Do you use templates?**\n> The site layout is a template through [micro.blog](https://micro.blog/). I don't use any templates in my post content. I've thought about it, for something like a weekly review post. Maybe I will at some point.\n\n- **How well do you know the languages used to create homepages, such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP?**\n> I'm fluent in all of those things, but prefer not to do it. I haven't written a line of PHP since probably 2006? HTML, CSS, and JS are all more recent, but I'd rather not unless I absolutely have to.\n\n- **When operating your site, do you ever pay attention to the number of accesses and update frequency of other sites?**\n> Not at all. I try not to measure myself against others.\n\n- **Please let me know if you have any recommendations for sites or books that support site production.**\n> Look at the source code for sites you think are doing something cool, and see if you can figure out how they did it. Don't steal their entire layout and style, that's what we call Not Cool, but the best way to learn in my experience is to figure out how someone did what you're trying to do.\n\n- **What is your working environment (devices, etc.)?**\n> Laptop: 2023 Apple Macbook Pro with M3 Pro.\n\n> Monitor: An HP 4K monitor, whose exact model number I don't recall.\n\n> Mouse: Logitech MX Master 3.\n\n> Keyboard: [WASD 104-key](https://www.wasdkeyboards.com/wasd-v3-104-key-doubleshot-pbt-black-slate-mechanical-keyboard.html) w/ custom keycaps designed to look like an old mainframe terminal.\n\n- **Please tell me where and when you usually work.**\n> I work from home full time, from my tiny office filled with cool books.\n\n- **Do you often listen to music, radio, etc. while working?**\n> Sometimes. I've been listening to music the entire time I've been writing this post. Frequently I need to interact with people, and I find that I need total silence for the deepest thought-work.\n\n- **Is there a drink you often drink while working?**\n> Coffee!\n\n- **Do you think you will still be using this site in 10 years?**\n> Statistically speaking? No. But I hope that I'm still an authentic participant in the small and indie web movements.\n\n- **What is your ideal site?**\n> No JavaScript of any kind, for any reason.\n\n- **Please let me know if there is anything you would like to do on the site in the future.**\n> I'm still trying to figure out what this site could be, and I think playing is half the fun. My guess is as long as I keep trying new things, then I'm doing the right thing.\n\n- **Please give me one last comment.**\n> The internet is only as good as we make it. Don't cede ground to the corporate overlords. Be actively working to build the world you want to live in.\n",

Especially during the annual <a href=\"https://updates.kickstarter.com/zine-quest-2023-kickstarters-annual-open-call-for-rpg-zines-returns-in-february/\">ZineQuest</a>, where indie TTRPG creators are encouraged to take a chance on the small, wild ideas that sometimes grow up to be Something Big.</p>\n<p>At PAX Unplugged I had the chance to speak briefly with one such creator, and they asked me what I looked for when I was deciding to back a project, so this post is written to them. Well. Also you, you&rsquo;re reading it. Hi! But mostly to them, and anyone else who might at some point want to try to publish a TTRPG supplement.</p>\n<p>What I&rsquo;d like to do is go through each of the projects I&rsquo;ve decided to back in the <a href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/discover/advanced?ref=section-zinequest-projectcollection-tag-newest&amp;sort=newest&amp;tag_id=346\">2024 ZineQuest</a> and explain why, exactly, it caught my eye. Plus a couple I decided not to back but want to promote. I won&rsquo;t be punching down and talking about anything I decided not to back. That&rsquo;s feedback that might be useful to those specific creators if they ever asked for it, but I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s generally helpful to publish as a list.</p>\n<h3 id=\"first-a-rubric\">First, A Rubric</h3>\n<p>Essentially I&rsquo;m asking myself three questions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Do I think I would ever play it? (Medium-likely.)</li>\n<li>Do I think I could convince my friends to play it? (Almost impossible.)</li>\n<li>Do I think I could pilfer it for ideas or mechanics? (Most common outcome.)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Sometimes there&rsquo;s a few extra points tossed in for &ldquo;I think this idea is really cool and I want it to exist in the world,&rdquo; but you can&rsquo;t optimize for <em>je ne sais quoi</em>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"things-im-backing\">Things I&rsquo;m Backing</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/wythe/blister-critters\">Blister Critters</a> &ndash; I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ll ever convince my friends to play this, but the art and idea are unique, the presentation is outstanding, and it&rsquo;s entirely unlike the canon of TTRPGs I already own. This is the game I expect people to be copying in ZineQuest 2025.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/robinfjarem/shadow-over-gloomshire\">Shadow over Gloomshire</a> &ndash; Five words in the project description were all it took: &ldquo;dark fantasy and gothic horror.&rdquo; This falls into the category of things I&rsquo;m not sure will be directly useful to me, but I want more of it to exist in the world.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/mikelorette/the-lair-of-the-skateomancer\">The Lair of the Skateomancer</a> &ndash; I really want to see how the skateboard is implemented as a magic item, and I&rsquo;m interested in the skatepark themed lair. It seems just ridiculous enough to work.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/rightafterthen/radish-quest\">Radish Quest</a> &ndash; The art is half of what sold me. Half of the remaining half is that I&rsquo;ve backed another project from this creator before and been happy with it. The remaining half-half is the all-in dedication to the bit in the project description. Radishes.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/moonmax/the-wigmakers-fingers\">The Wigmaker&rsquo;s Fingers</a> &ndash; A heist where you steal a prosthetic finger. Everything about the way this is packaged makes me want to know more, and the samples of the layout on the book look great.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/ravensridge/cartograph-atlas-edition-a-solo-mapmaking-ttrpg\">Cartograph - Atlas Edition: A Mapmaking TTRPG</a> &ndash; I&rsquo;m interested in the mechanics. Like many TTRPG nerds I someday wish to publish my own world as a supplement, and I&rsquo;m usually interested in systems that I think could help me develop that world.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/residentbard/i-crave-the-loop\">I Crave The Loop</a> &ndash; Curious to see how the mechanics work, plus the name and idea are clever.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/crum/details\">The Details of Our Escape</a> &ndash; Mostly I want to see how the domino mechanic works, but the art also looks compelling.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/sleepysasquatch/courier-repacked\">Courier - Repacked</a> &ndash; The description reads a lot more like a solo board game than a TTRPG to me, so I&rsquo;m curious to see what that&rsquo;s about. It also claims to touch on some interesting ideas, like building a base, and I want to see how that&rsquo;s implemented. I&rsquo;ve always liked the idea of the players being able to make a home, but I find a lot of the mechanics for doing that in traditional TTRPGs to lack depth or interest.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/4randompixels/valheks-guide-to-treasure-hunting\">Valhek&rsquo;s Guide to Treasure Hunting</a> &ndash; At $3 the PDF falls squarely into &ldquo;why not&rdquo; territory. It only needs to have one interesting monster or magic item to feel like I&rsquo;ve probably got my money&rsquo;s worth.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/bclev/8-bit-theater-the-roleplaying-game\">8-BIT THEATER THE ROLEPLAYING GAME</a> &ndash; Many hundreds of years ago I was an avid reader of 8-Bit Theater. Honestly I&rsquo;m just glad Brian Clevenger is still out there, doing his thing. This is somewhat me just kicking some money to a creator who brought me a lot of joy a very long time ago. It mostly doesn&rsquo;t matter if the product is any good. But it looks like it probably will be, if nothing else, pretty funny.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/hungryfamiliar/bookwyrm-loot-some-books\">Bookwyrm: Loot some books!</a> &ndash; Much like Valhek&rsquo;s Guide, the $4 entry price for a PDF of random tables is enough to get it a &ldquo;why not.&rdquo; The concept is cute, and I could probably make use of it in a campaign somewhere.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/scottwegener/cult-of-the-morach-an-old-school-adventure\">Cult of the Morach: An Old School Adventure</a> &ndash; Mostly interested to see how the encounter clocks function. That&rsquo;s something I&rsquo;ve done before, and I think it can be a useful way to pace events that happen whether or not the players are paying attention. I&rsquo;m curious to see if there&rsquo;s a better way to do it. The adventure itself looks like it could also be interesting, but it&rsquo;s for a system I don&rsquo;t play, so it&rsquo;s probably going to serve as inspiration and not be something I ever use directly.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/eryksawicki/milk-bar-sci-fi-osr-roleplaying-in-post-communist-poland\">Milk Bar: sci-fi roleplaying in post-Soviet Poland</a> &ndash; Once again looking at the base building mechanics, although the setting is also wholly new to me. I didn&rsquo;t know what a Milk Bar was before. The physical edition and layout also looks fantastic.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/dimdayred/dimday-red-ttrpg-nodus-02\">Dimday Red TTRPG - Nodus Zine 02</a> &ndash; I backed the original Dimday Red kickstarter in ZineQuest 2023, and I think the world is an interesting one. Mid-apocalyptic catches me in much the same way post-apocalyptic would, but it&rsquo;s a relatively unique take. Stories rarely linger in the middle of the world ending.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/bodieh/mystery-under-magi-mart\">Mystery Under Magi-Mart</a> &ndash; I think this might be a fun thing to run as a Line Entertainment [E]nforcer at PAX.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/brookletgames/beetle-knight\">Beetle Knight</a> &ndash; You can be a moth.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/johnsonofair/the-tower-a-puzzle-dungeon-crawl\">The Tower - A System Agnostic Puzzle Dungeon Crawl</a> &ndash; This hits a few highlights. It&rsquo;s a puzzle/riddle dungeon and it&rsquo;s system agnostic. The kind of thing I&rsquo;m likely to be able to slip into any campaign where it might be useful. Too many supplements want to give me more monsters, but I don&rsquo;t really need more monsters. I have too many already. A good puzzle that players might enjoy solving is hard to come by.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/dngnclub/dngn-club-relics-remastered-vol-1\">DNGN CLUB: Relics Remastered Vol. 1</a> &ndash; A kitchen sink of the author&rsquo;s best ideas. Some of the samples are evocative. I&rsquo;m curious to see what can be pilfered.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/9thlevel/sentai-and-sensibility\">Sentai &amp; Sensibility RPG</a> &ndash; If you have never wanted to be simultaneously both the green Power Ranger and also Mr Darcy, then I&rsquo;m not entirely certain that we can relate. But if you have, now is your chance.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/gametee/thrifty-trades-of-fey-zine-quest\">Thrifty Trades of Fey</a> &ndash; I&rsquo;ve backed just about everything <a href=\"https://gametee.co.uk/\">Gametee</a> have ever made and been delighted by all of it. What particularly caught my eye is the use of an origami fortune teller. I want to see how they make use of it as a mechanic.</p>\n<h2 id=\"things-im-not-backing\">Things I&rsquo;m Not Backing</h2>\n<p>These are projects that I&rsquo;m not getting for one reason or another, but I think they&rsquo;re cool and maybe you&rsquo;ll be interested.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/aethercorp/field-agent-handbook\">Field Agent Handbooks: Observancy Dept. 1924–28</a> &ndash; This is a cool idea, but I know to my teeth that I&rsquo;d never make any use of it. The idea doesn&rsquo;t seem to be pilferable. For the right person this would probably be a lot of fun, I&rsquo;m just not that person.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/josiahmoore/tiny-fables\">Tiny Fables</a> &ndash; The art on this is gorgeous, but it&rsquo;s for a system I don&rsquo;t play and don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ll pick up. The examples make it seem like it would be difficult to adapt any of it to the games I do play.</p>\n",

That's feedback that might be useful to those specific creators if they ever asked for it, but I don't think it's generally helpful to publish as a list.\n\n### First, A Rubric\nEssentially I'm asking myself three questions:\n- Do I think I would ever play it? (Medium-likely.)\n- Do I think I could convince my friends to play it? (Almost impossible.)\n- Do I think I could pilfer it for ideas or mechanics? (Most common outcome.)\n\nSometimes there's a few extra points tossed in for \"I think this idea is really cool and I want it to exist in the world,\" but you can't optimize for *je ne sais quoi*.\n\n## Things I'm Backing\n[Blister Critters](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/wythe/blister-critters) -- I don't think I'll ever convince my friends to play this, but the art and idea are unique, the presentation is outstanding, and it's entirely unlike the canon of TTRPGs I already own. This is the game I expect people to be copying in ZineQuest 2025.\n\n[Shadow over Gloomshire](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/robinfjarem/shadow-over-gloomshire) -- Five words in the project description were all it took: \"dark fantasy and gothic horror.\" This falls into the category of things I'm not sure will be directly useful to me, but I want more of it to exist in the world.\n\n[The Lair of the Skateomancer](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/mikelorette/the-lair-of-the-skateomancer) -- I really want to see how the skateboard is implemented as a magic item, and I'm interested in the skatepark themed lair. It seems just ridiculous enough to work.\n\n[Radish Quest](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/rightafterthen/radish-quest) -- The art is half of what sold me. Half of the remaining half is that I've backed another project from this creator before and been happy with it. The remaining half-half is the all-in dedication to the bit in the project description. Radishes.\n\n[The Wigmaker's Fingers](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/moonmax/the-wigmakers-fingers) -- A heist where you steal a prosthetic finger. Everything about the way this is packaged makes me want to know more, and the samples of the layout on the book look great.\n\n[Cartograph - Atlas Edition: A Mapmaking TTRPG](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/ravensridge/cartograph-atlas-edition-a-solo-mapmaking-ttrpg) -- I'm interested in the mechanics. Like many TTRPG nerds I someday wish to publish my own world as a supplement, and I'm usually interested in systems that I think could help me develop that world.\n\n[I Crave The Loop](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/residentbard/i-crave-the-loop) -- Curious to see how the mechanics work, plus the name and idea are clever.\n\n[The Details of Our Escape](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/crum/details) -- Mostly I want to see how the domino mechanic works, but the art also looks compelling.\n\n[Courier - Repacked](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/sleepysasquatch/courier-repacked) -- The description reads a lot more like a solo board game than a TTRPG to me, so I'm curious to see what that's about. It also claims to touch on some interesting ideas, like building a base, and I want to see how that's implemented. I've always liked the idea of the players being able to make a home, but I find a lot of the mechanics for doing that in traditional TTRPGs to lack depth or interest.\n\n[Valhek's Guide to Treasure Hunting](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/4randompixels/valheks-guide-to-treasure-hunting) -- At $3 the PDF falls squarely into \"why not\" territory. It only needs to have one interesting monster or magic item to feel like I've probably got my money's worth.\n\n[8-BIT THEATER THE ROLEPLAYING GAME](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/bclev/8-bit-theater-the-roleplaying-game) -- Many hundreds of years ago I was an avid reader of 8-Bit Theater. Honestly I'm just glad Brian Clevenger is still out there, doing his thing. This is somewhat me just kicking some money to a creator who brought me a lot of joy a very long time ago. It mostly doesn't matter if the product is any good. But it looks like it probably will be, if nothing else, pretty funny.\n\n[Bookwyrm: Loot some books!](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/hungryfamiliar/bookwyrm-loot-some-books) -- Much like Valhek's Guide, the $4 entry price for a PDF of random tables is enough to get it a \"why not.\" The concept is cute, and I could probably make use of it in a campaign somewhere.\n\n[Cult of the Morach: An Old School Adventure](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/scottwegener/cult-of-the-morach-an-old-school-adventure) -- Mostly interested to see how the encounter clocks function. That's something I've done before, and I think it can be a useful way to pace events that happen whether or not the players are paying attention. I'm curious to see if there's a better way to do it. The adventure itself looks like it could also be interesting, but it's for a system I don't play, so it's probably going to serve as inspiration and not be something I ever use directly.\n\n[Milk Bar: sci-fi roleplaying in post-Soviet Poland](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/eryksawicki/milk-bar-sci-fi-osr-roleplaying-in-post-communist-poland) -- Once again looking at the base building mechanics, although the setting is also wholly new to me. I didn't know what a Milk Bar was before. The physical edition and layout also looks fantastic.\n\n[Dimday Red TTRPG - Nodus Zine 02](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/dimdayred/dimday-red-ttrpg-nodus-02) -- I backed the original Dimday Red kickstarter in ZineQuest 2023, and I think the world is an interesting one. Mid-apocalyptic catches me in much the same way post-apocalyptic would, but it's a relatively unique take. Stories rarely linger in the middle of the world ending.\n\n[Mystery Under Magi-Mart](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/bodieh/mystery-under-magi-mart) -- I think this might be a fun thing to run as a Line Entertainment \\[E\\]nforcer at PAX.\n\n[Beetle Knight](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/brookletgames/beetle-knight) -- You can be a moth.\n\n[The Tower - A System Agnostic Puzzle Dungeon Crawl](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/johnsonofair/the-tower-a-puzzle-dungeon-crawl) -- This hits a few highlights. It's a puzzle/riddle dungeon and it's system agnostic. The kind of thing I'm likely to be able to slip into any campaign where it might be useful. Too many supplements want to give me more monsters, but I don't really need more monsters. I have too many already. A good puzzle that players might enjoy solving is hard to come by.\n\n[DNGN CLUB: Relics Remastered Vol. 1](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/dngnclub/dngn-club-relics-remastered-vol-1) -- A kitchen sink of the author's best ideas. Some of the samples are evocative. I'm curious to see what can be pilfered.\n\n[Sentai & Sensibility RPG](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/9thlevel/sentai-and-sensibility) -- If you have never wanted to be simultaneously both the green Power Ranger and also Mr Darcy, then I'm not entirely certain that we can relate. But if you have, now is your chance.\n\n[Thrifty Trades of Fey](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/gametee/thrifty-trades-of-fey-zine-quest) -- I've backed just about everything [Gametee](https://gametee.co.uk/) have ever made and been delighted by all of it. What particularly caught my eye is the use of an origami fortune teller. I want to see how they make use of it as a mechanic.\n\n## Things I'm Not Backing\nThese are projects that I'm not getting for one reason or another, but I think they're cool and maybe you'll be interested.\n\n[Field Agent Handbooks: Observancy Dept. 1924–28](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/aethercorp/field-agent-handbook) -- This is a cool idea, but I know to my teeth that I'd never make any use of it. The idea doesn't seem to be pilferable. For the right person this would probably be a lot of fun, I'm just not that person.\n\n[Tiny Fables](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/josiahmoore/tiny-fables) -- The art on this is gorgeous, but it's for a system I don't play and don't think I'll pick up. The examples make it seem like it would be difficult to adapt any of it to the games I do play.\n \n",

Having never been to Hawaii, or indeed to any &ldquo;tropical&rdquo; or &ldquo;island&rdquo; destination, I tacked on a short mini-vacation the weekend before the work portion. Then the work part got cancelled, and my &ldquo;mini&rdquo; vacation was non-refundable. So, okay. I guess I&rsquo;m going on a short trip to Hawaii. No plans, no friends. Just me and the island.</p>\n<h3 id=\"day-1---wednesday\">Day 1 - Wednesday</h3>\n<p>I like going places, don&rsquo;t mind flying, but hate airports. The American airport experience is designed to maximize suffering at every touchpoint. With an 8-hour direct flight basically all of Wednesday was dedicated to the trip. Here I want to shout out to American Airlines' premium economy, which made the experience significantly more comfortable. I&rsquo;d say it&rsquo;s roughly equivalent to Alaska Airlines' first class. The seats alone are worth the price of admission.</p>\n<p>When I stepped off the airplane, however, I felt the first moist slap of Hawaiian air and&hellip; Well. Have you ever heard of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_syndrome\">Paris syndrome</a>? The short version is that Paris is nothing at all like how it&rsquo;s presented in the movies, and when some people experience it &ldquo;in the flesh&rdquo; for the first time the delta between expectation and reality leads to a bunch of negative symptoms.</p>\n<p>I can&rsquo;t say it was exactly like that, but expectation definitely didn&rsquo;t match reality. I can&rsquo;t explain why it never occurred to me that Hawaii would be hot and humid, but it&rsquo;s not what I was prepared for. Mentally, physically, emotionally, financially. In retrospect the fact that I even wore a hoodie now strikes me as hilariously unprepared. But also I didn&rsquo;t even bring a pair of shorts.</p>\n<p>So I caught a Lyft to my hotel in Waikiki, turned the air conditioning as low as it could possibly go, and ordered <a href=\"https://www.hawaiianbarbecue.com/\">L&amp;L</a> on a delivery app. Wednesday was a write-off.

I found a local malasada place and brought them back to my hotel&rsquo;s (not yet open) beach bar, where they were greatly enjoyed. I watched a series of three catamarans beach themselves, which was shocking and unexpected the first time but which I now gather is a fairly common way of parking there.

				"content_html": "<p>As part of the Year of Scales and Arpeggios I find myself needing to keep track of new things in new ways. The problem is that tracking things, like naming them, is hard. Maybe it&rsquo;s less hard for people that don&rsquo;t suffer from perfectionism. It&rsquo;s hard for me. The ideal system is one which tracks itself, but those are few and far between and rarely support the other principles that matter to me.</p>\n<p>One of the things I want to improve on is how much time I spend on my hobbies. To be clear: it&rsquo;s currently not enough. I would like to spend more time on my hobbies. But I&rsquo;ve got a lot of other things competing for my time, and that means left to my own devices I won&rsquo;t naturally spend more time working on the things that I want to work on. So I&rsquo;m tracking it. Currently the form of that tracking is a daily tick box in my 2024 Hobonichi Techo Cousin. Pro: it&rsquo;s flexible to my needs. Con: it&rsquo;s hard to remember to look in the planner.</p>\n<p>I suppose I could talk about planners in general, the problem being that I absolutely adore the tactile feel of paper, but I don&rsquo;t find it very useful to try to manage my mostly-digital life with mostly-analog tools. There&rsquo;s occasionally value in enforcing the gap, and I think that I think better &ldquo;on paper,&rdquo; but I know that trying to move my calendar or todo list to paper would be foolhardy at best and catastrophic at worst.</p>\n<p>So, better or worse, I&rsquo;ve got a paper planner that I mostly don&rsquo;t use for traditional planning. But it gives me room to explore the space. Maybe these checkboxes are the path forward, maybe they&rsquo;re not, but they&rsquo;re much easier to change if I figure out something better than if I doubled-down on an app-based solution that would only ever work &ldquo;how it works,&rdquo; and likely require me to test 3-5 different apps to find the one that worked the way I needed it to. In my experience, apps are rarely a solution to any problems.

				"content_text": "As part of the Year of Scales and Arpeggios I find myself needing to keep track of new things in new ways. The problem is that tracking things, like naming them, is hard. Maybe it's less hard for people that don't suffer from perfectionism. It's hard for me. The ideal system is one which tracks itself, but those are few and far between and rarely support the other principles that matter to me.\n\nOne of the things I want to improve on is how much time I spend on my hobbies. To be clear: it's currently not enough. I would like to spend more time on my hobbies. But I've got a lot of other things competing for my time, and that means left to my own devices I won't naturally spend more time working on the things that I want to work on. So I'm tracking it. Currently the form of that tracking is a daily tick box in my 2024 Hobonichi Techo Cousin. Pro: it's flexible to my needs. Con: it's hard to remember to look in the planner.\n\nI suppose I could talk about planners in general, the problem being that I absolutely adore the tactile feel of paper, but I don't find it very useful to try to manage my mostly-digital life with mostly-analog tools. There's occasionally value in enforcing the gap, and I think that I think better \"on paper,\" but I know that trying to move my calendar or todo list to paper would be foolhardy at best and catastrophic at worst.\n\nSo, better or worse, I've got a paper planner that I mostly don't use for traditional planning. But it gives me room to explore the space. Maybe these checkboxes are the path forward, maybe they're not, but they're much easier to change if I figure out something better than if I doubled-down on an app-based solution that would only ever work \"how it works,\" and likely require me to test 3-5 different apps to find the one that worked the way I needed it to. In my experience, apps are rarely a solution to any problems. They are frequently the problem I'm attempting to solve.\n\nLast week's boxes were:\n- Up by 8\n- Morning planning\n- Apple rings\n- 40K\n- Reading\n- Sleep\n\nI've already reworked that to:\n- Awake on time\n- 30 minute walk\n- Hobby\n- Reading\n- Asleep on time\n\nMost days I want to be up by 8, but not all, so generalizing the check makes it easier to set up my planner each week. A checkmark for whether or not I closed all my apple rings is somewhat redundant, since I can look that up at any time. Much more useful is to track whether I engaged in the behaviors that lead to the desired result. \"Hobby\" remains to be seen if it meets the need. The main hobby I want to do more of is Warhammer 40K, but it's not my only hobby and there are nights where I have commitments or obligations that consume the time I might otherwise spend. I suspect that one will change again, even though I don't yet know how I'd change it.\n\nReading deserves a special call-out. Arguably, it's a hobby, but it's one I've struggled to maintain to my own satisfaction for nearly 20 years. In high school I was voracious, not least of which because I was often ignoring the teachers. I wish I had something approximating Goodreads data for how many books I used to read, but subjectively I'd estimate a 2x-3x over my best year as an adult.

And then, to make sure I don't accidentally forget to sleep because \"just one more chapter,\" I track that I lay down to sleep on time. Midnight, for the curious.\n\nI like that paper gives me the freedom to try to figure out the best way to track this.
