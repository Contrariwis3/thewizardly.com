			 <p>Lately I’ve been trying a new system for how I manage my evenings. Someone else might try “no system” or “having fun” or “relaxing,” but I am not that someone.</p>
<p>Instead, I’ve cobbled together something from the charred husk of the <a href="https://www.morgen.so/blog-posts/bento-method">Bento Method</a> that seems to work pretty well for me.</p>
<p>Of course, to make that make sense, I have to describe what came before.</p>
<p>In the early days there was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/StumbleUpon">StumbleUpon</a>, and it wasted a lot of time, and I got nothing done for approximately 2008-2016. Very little of that is StumbleUpon’s fault. I just wanted to mention StumbleUpon for some OG time wasting cred.</p>
<p>By the early 2010s I was using the then-nascent Bullet Journal method. By the late 2010s I was using GTD.</p>
<p>Over the last half year I’ve been using time blocking, which has gone through several iterations. Originally rough time estimates became fixed time blocks, deep focus to light focus. The problem with that level of fixed schedule was that frequently the real world happened, and things slipped, and I had no good way to get them back on track.</p>
<p>Once the train missed the station it was hard to go back.</p>
<p>I was looking at the Bento Method and I thought, “well, this seems interesting.” Not really looking to buy a new app though. I’m actually quite happy with OmniFocus. But the idea of setting tasks that sort of roughly align with how I was time blocking, but that would remain to be re-scheduled if I missed them was pretty compelling. And seemed to solve for my main pain point with what I was doing previously.</p>
<p>The other problem I set out to solve, related but unrelated, was bringing more focus to a single project at a time. I tend to have too many hobbies and interests, and in turn tend not to get very many projects to a proper “finished” state.</p>
<p>So I married the bento method up with two week sprints. I actually like sprints. I know, crazy, right? But I like the idea of bringing a limited amount of laser-sharp focus to a problem. And, I was able to bake in a little bit of a reward. After my two weeks? A week off!</p>
<p>I’m now halfway through my second week of my first sprint under this system, and it’s been great. I’ve gotten a satisfying amount of work done on a single project. Naively I thought one sprint would be enough to finish it, but of course bringing my attention to bear meant I found all kinds of new things it could be extended to do.</p>
<p>C’est la vie. At least I have next week’s “break” to look forward to.</p>

			 <p>I’m not a traditionally “goal-motivated” person. For certain values of goal, motivated, and person. I have a formative memory of telling my third grade teacher that I would not be setting any new years resolutions because the idea is quite ridiculous, thank you.</p>
<p>I continue to agree with past-me about that.</p>
<p>“Goals” are sort of like a report card: some people are super motivated by getting good grades for some reason. If this is you, stop it. Grades are a scam. Do as little as you can to pass, and spend as much of your time as possible being curious about the world around you. Go outside. Lick a bug. Everything worth doing is as far from a classroom as you are allowed to get.</p>
<p>I digress.</p>
<p>Nothing about having a goal helps you achieve a goal. The goal doesn’t define the process that leads to the goal’s success. The goal doesn’t punish you for failure. The goal is Gary Busey standing over your bed breathing <em>slightly</em> too loud while you sleep. Unsettling, perhaps, but it’s not kicking your ass and telling you to achieve your destiny.</p>
<p>You’re defined by what you do, not by what you say you’ll do. Set a goal to have beautiful teeth in a decade and then stop brushing your teeth. Clearly the operative lever here, the essential fulcrum, is the tooth brushing habit.</p>
<p>Best case scenario, you’ve set out to do something you were already going to do, and you did it. Most likely case scenario you failed to achieve the goal, were a failure, should pour salt on yourself, shrivel up, and die.</p>
<p>Yes, I am a perfectionist, why do you ask?</p>
<p>I can’t speak to how anyone else conceives of goals. I suspect not like I do. Given the above, can you blame me for not finding them motivating? A “goal,” as described, is an opportunity to demonstrate my limitless capacity to fail at my own ambitions. Why would I even start down that path?</p>
<p>Except, apparently, I have always set what a normal, rational person would call goals. If you’ve known me long enough you’ve probably heard me say I want to be the CEO of the company. Quite possibly with an almost <strong>feverish level of intensity</strong>.</p>
<p>Listen, I know I’m not going to be the CEO. I mean maybe <em>a CEO</em>. Eventually. But not at my current day job.</p>
<p>This is what I call a <em>Wildly Unachievable Goal</em>. The point isn’t to ever do the thing. It’s to pick a direction, burn the boats, set out across the American Southwest, and see how close I get. Because every step of the way is valuable. I’ll learn, I’ll grow. I’ll end up closer to it than I ever might have imagined.</p>
<p>I think that for a WUG to work, you have to take it at face value. You have to believe in it with your heart and spleen. If at any point you acknowledge that it’s not really your intention, the magic breaks. It’s the productivity equivalent of  a placebo.</p>
<p>Something new I’m trying out are Wildly Achievable Goals. WAGs. This is, I think, much closer to what a normal person would call a “goal.” It’s a thing I want to do, or have, or be, that through a reasonable series of steps, could happen.</p>
<p>A WAG might be “write a book.” It might be “launch an app on the App Store.” They’re things that normal human people do, but maybe you’ve never done.</p>
<p>The point of a WAG is that at the end of it, you have the thing you set out to do. No matter how audacious it is, you have reason to believe you could do it. No matter how long it takes, you think you could get it done.</p>
<p>A WUG is something you know you’ll never do, but you’re going to run full-chested at it anyway, because the point isn’t to get there, it’s to land among the stars.</p>
<p>WAG and WUG. Pass it on.</p>

			 <p>Once upon a time if you asked a kid what they wanted to be when they grew up you’d get answers like “policeman” or “scientist.” I’m sure nowadays it’s YouTuber, Streamer, or Sentient Minecraft Block.</p>
<p>Unfortunately for me, I still don’t know the answer to this question. I’ve got two options on the table and roughly six months to pick. But first, to make any of it make sense, we need to go back to the halcyon days of 19-<em>mumblemumble</em>.</p>
<h2>Chapter 1</h2>
<p>I was the unplanned, unwanted side effect of a single night of passion. </p>
<p>This meant a lot of things, not least of which that my mother wasn’t prepared to have a child. She worked for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planned_Parenthood">Planned Parenthood</a> and they were not interested in having an unwed mother on staff. It didn’t really fit the image of the brand.</p>
<p>This meant I arrived into the world with a parent who had no aspirations, no savings, and no job. An auspicious start. </p>
<p>But I’m not here to talk shit about my mom. Whatever other disagreements we’ve had, which are many, she realized that she had a duty to the life she’d brought into this world, and that led her to go back to school. She got an associates of nursing, and spent the entire rest of her career as a geriatric care nurse.</p>
<p>Why? It’s what my grandmother had done. And, to quote my mom, quoting my nana, “go into nursing and you’ll never receive a pink slip in your life.”<sup><a href="#fn1-2726" id="fnr1-2726" title="see footnote" class="footnote">1</a></sup></p>
<p>For whatever semblance of success I’ve achieved in life, know this. I got here by a combination of clawing my way out of the dirt from whence I came, mentors who took kindly and saw potential in me, and an inexhaustible font of luck.</p>
<p>I learned many things in my misspent youth. Several of them things I would need to go on to un-learn in pursuit of success. But key among them, the importance of steady and reliable work. There is not one member of my family who could provide me with a safety net. When I almost became homeless again in my 20s, only the grace of a family friend spared me.</p>
<p>As a consequence, I’ve never had the luxury of batting for the fences. Following your passion is great advice for the middle-class with a parent’s basement you could land softly in if you fail. If you’ve ever wondered why I didn’t go found Facebook, or any of a thousand other things, this is why. Because even when I lived in an RV, I had no interest in sleeping in my car.</p>
<h2>Chapter 2</h2>
<p>I signed a contract to work in the video game industry on the literal day of my 18th birthday, not even having graduated High School. And it was awful. I have not one nice thing to say about it. Technically I shipped production code for an MMO. There’s a slim chance you’ve even played it.</p>
<p>The video game industry was, and still is, a wildly abusive place to work. People do it for the love of the game. They do it because they’re passionate about what they do. Not knowing any better, I ran from it. I spent the next 10 years, give or take, trying to do anything else.</p>
<p>I managed an arcade.</p>
<p>I did data analysis for the American Red Cross.</p>
<p>I did IT for a public university.</p>
<p>And importantly, I spent as much money as the government would let me floating around community college. Trying to figure out any other option for what I could do with my life. Anything except work with computers.</p>
<p>Which is why I was able to accrue basically every associates degree they offered, in a wide variety of topics. I think it’s plausible that I took all of the classes. All of them. Which was fascinating and I absolutely would do for the rest of my life if I could get paid to do it. Just audit 100 and 200 level community college classes. It’s the best.</p>
<p>But when the money started to run dry, it became obvious that I needed to pick exactly one thing, and it needed to be something I could stick with. So I picked the safe thing. The thing that I knew I could do, and which would keep me employed. I transferred up to a state university, and I got my degree in Computer Science.</p>
<p>And there’s the thing. I <strong>am</strong> good at it. My mother tells an apocryphal story about a time when she was in college and a professor set me up on a jailed terminal to keep me busy, and not five minutes later I had broken out.</p>
<p>Ladies and gentlemen I’ve been hackin’ since <em>I was three.</em></p>
<p>From 286s I scrounged together from trash my grade school was throwing away, to a Kaypro 4 that my mom managed to find used from a coworker. I’ve been tinkering on computers in any way I could as long as I could. I knew BASIC in 5th grade. I was fluent in C++ in 8th. I wrote a MUD for my senior project.</p>
<p>The purpose of this is not to toot my own horn, although a think some occasional horn-tooting is valid. It’s to try to establish a crumb of <em>bona fides</em> in a forum where I’ve generally avoided mentioning anything about what it is that I do to provide economic value. As much as I wish I were the idle rich, I am not. I am a certified computer toucher.</p>
<p>But see here’s the thing. While young-me thoroughly enjoyed the mysteries of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit">thinking-sand-box</a>, adult-me mostly hates the blasted things.</p>
<p>If I could figure out a way to make a living without ever turning on another computer in my life, without a significant degradation of quality of life from all the online friends I’d never talk to again? Dear reader I would reenact the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KinUMIS3Yc">fax machine scene</a> from Office Space on every computer within a 10km radius.</p>
<p>I have slowly been turning into <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jubal_Harshaw">Jubal Harshaw</a> for about three decades with no sign of stopping now.</p>
<p>Because I got backed into a wall by the limits of financial aid I “failed up” into a successful career as a computer toucher, which I have spent my nights and weekends trying to break free from ever since.</p>
<h2>Chapter 3</h2>
<p>Let us assume, for the sake of argument, that I have two career paths in front of me.</p>
<p>On the one hand, I could become President of Earth.
On the other hand, I could become an Astronaut.</p>
<p>Yes these are metaphors.</p>
<p>There’s a lot to recommend President of Earth. With great power comes great responsibility, and great compensation. It represents the safe path, but is also a path that brings no real joy. I would be in great company, the world is filled with talented, driven, creative people that just need to pay the mortgage.</p>
<p>As President of Earth, I would need to work longer hours, I would need to do many things I would not enjoy. But the satisfaction would come from the ways in which it would enable a comfortable life. In the knowledge that despite my upbringing, I climbed to the top. That I achieved to the very highest levels, despite it all. All the people who believed in me that I proved right. All the people who didn’t that I proved wrong.</p>
<p>It’s unlikely that I could become President of Earth and then abandon the post. While all things remain possible, it requires <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_handcuffs">making commitments</a> that will close other doors. </p>
<p>The alternative is becoming an Astronaut. To pursue with wild abandon a result that most people never attempt. And of those who try, most never succeed. It is to chase the thing which is clearly my true passion, or as close as I think I have to one.<sup><a href="#fn2-2726" id="fnr2-2726" title="see footnote" class="footnote">2</a></sup></p>
<p>It would be a risk of the highest magnitude, with an uncertain end. But the chance that maybe, just maybe, I’d land among the stars.</p>
<p>However, to become an Astronaut I’d need to begin making changes. There would be a training regimen. A rocket must be constructed. For the next several years I would be engaged in the process of transforming myself into the kind of person who could go to space. That is wholly incompatible with the duties and responsibilities of President of Earth.</p>
<p>Importantly, I would also need to build a landing pad. Because if I did not launch successfully, I would need a net to catch me. The kind that I have never had before, and which stopped me from ever trying anything this audacious in the past.</p>
<h2>The Grand Question</h2>
<p>Few things in life are certain, and nothing is guaranteed. But for reasons outside my control I believe I will need to commit to one path or another in the near future. If only because dithering about one will close the door.</p>
<p>It does not mean that I’m planning any drastic changes (hi coworkers, if you’re reading this, I’m not planning to quit any time soon. I really like working where I work, inasmuch as I like working at all.)</p>
<p>What I’m really talking about is setting the trajectory for where I want to be in five to seven years. Because I don’t think I’ll be happy staying exactly where I am.</p>
<p>I either need to run for office, or start building a rocket, and it may be one of the hardest decisions I’ve ever had to make.</p>

			 <p>Have you ever lost something and then spent the next ten years trying to find it?</p>
<p>I have. It’s an essay about the fall of the Roman Empire. Did the average citizen know the empire had fallen?</p>
<p>No. It took them about 200 years to figure out, but you’re just going to have to trust me because all the kings horses and all the king’s men haven’t been able to find that paper again.</p>
<h2>All of this is backstory</h2>
<p>Back in 2020 I got way into the idea of Personal Knowledge Management (PKM) and went about setting up my first “<a href="https://thesweetsetup.com/the-pkm-stack/">PKM Stack</a>,” or set of tools for solving the problem: how do I stop losing all the interesting things I read.</p>
<p>The first version of this stack used <a href="https://www.instapaper.com/">Instapaper</a> as my read-it-later, IFTTT, Dropbox, and Obsidian. The workflow sucked. But the basic idea was I’d read something, if it had any highlights those would get put in a markdown file in Dropbox by IFTTT, and then I’d manually drag it over to Obsidian eventually.</p>
<p>When AI first started taking off Instapaper used it as an opportunity to raise their rates, and not having been CRAZY happy with that solution, and not seeing any value in the then-state of AI, I used it as a chance to rethink, and ended up hopping to <a href="https://readwise.io/read">Readwise Reader</a>.</p>
<h2>Instapaper to Reader</h2>
<p>When I migrated from Instapaper to Reader it was, by necessity, an imperfect migration. Instapaper’s output format included a link to the original document, the parts I had highlighted, but not the document text. Reader had to go out and fetch the document bodies again, and in a handful of cases failed. Either because Reader couldn’t parse it, or because the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Link_rot">document was gone</a>.</p>
<p>I also had the habit of archiving everything in the hope I would be able to find it later if I needed. This comes from deep trauma: I’m <strong>still</strong> looking for a paper I read a decade ago about whether the average imperial citizen knew the Roman Empire had fallen.</p>
<p>The result is a large backlog of low-value things that I had read, and saved in case, that I was unlikely to ever look at again. Or find any value in if I did.</p>
<h2>Reader to the Future</h2>
<p>Reader is fine for, well, reading, but it’s got usability gaps for making notes and long-term storage. Especially since my primary modality for using it is on an iPad mini on a flight somewhere. Most of my life runs out of Obsidian, why not this?</p>
<p>After thinking about it I decided that I want every document that I “archive” in Reader to go through an enrichment pipeline that summarizes it, extracts any highlights, extracts any key ideas or topics, and puts a markdown file in the right part of my Obsidian vault with all that information and a link back to the Reader copy, so that I can reference it if needed.</p>
<p>To make it maximally useful, I needed to do this for everything in the archive, and to do that I needed to get rid of all the low-value documents hanging around in there.</p>
<h2>How to Build A Rubric And Learn to Love the Atomic Bomb</h2>
<p>Going through the entire archive was going to require a system that could look at everything and reliably decide what I should or shouldn’t keep. To do that, I needed to be able to describe what I would want to keep. I needed an interest rubric.</p>
<p>Have you ever tried to describe yourself? Like really describe yourself? Maybe this is easier for other people but man I struggled. I came up with I think about four core interests, but I knew that wasn’t accurate.</p>
<p>My next attempt was to open a conversation with Claude, explain to it what I was trying to do, and ask it to interview me. This was... Medium successful? It ended up being a much better place to start from but was not in and of itself nearly comprehensive. Again it continued to rely on the things I could think of to prompt it with.</p>
<p>Finally I thought, okay. Well. I’ve got this backlog of things I’ve read. I know it’s got some stuff I want to get rid of, but it’s also filled with lots of stuff I’d want to keep. Can I use that as the basis for a rubric?</p>
<p>Bingo.</p>
<p>The next problem was purely technical. Over 700 documents, many running into the tens of thousands of words. There was going to be no way to put them all into Claude’s context at once. I thought about it and figured “good enough” might be “good enough” at scale: I had Claude write a series of Python scripts that would randomly sample about half of the documents and post them to an OpenAI batch job with the goal of summarizing and extracting key insights.</p>
<p>I’m not certain if this was the absolute final version of the prompt, but it looked a lot like this:</p>
<blockquote>Your task is to analyze this document and create a comprehensive summary that would allow someone to understand its core value without reading the full text.
<p>Document Title: {doc[&lsquo;title&rsquo;]}
Author: {doc.get(&lsquo;author&rsquo;, &lsquo;Unknown&rsquo;)}
URL: {doc.get(&lsquo;url&rsquo;, &lsquo;Not provided&rsquo;)}</p>
<p>Content:
{doc[&lsquo;extracted_content&rsquo;][:15000]}  # Truncate very long content</p>
<p>Please provide:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>A concise but information-dense summary (2-3 paragraphs) that captures the key ideas, arguments, and context of the document.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>3-5 key insights or takeaways from the document that represent its most valuable content.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A brief assessment of why this content might be valuable to someone with interests in rationality, economics, science fiction, fantasy, and tabletop role-playing games. If the content seems unrelated to these areas, explain what type of person might find it valuable instead.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Format your response as structured JSON with the following keys:
&ldquo;summary&rdquo;, &ldquo;key_insights&rdquo; (as an array), and &ldquo;value_assessment&rdquo;.</blockquote></p>
<p>I think of “summarize a bunch of text” as something Large Language Models (LLMs, such as Claude or ChatGPT) are good at. Perfect use case.</p>
<p>My next step was to take the first Markdown file and the basis of my rubric from the interviews, and attach them to a conversation with Claude Sonnet 3.7 with Extended Thinking. I typed out like four paragraphs of stream-of-consciousness about what I was trying to do and asked it, in so many words: “based on all these summaries, what interests do you think I have that you don’t see on the rubric?”</p>
<p>Thus began a long dialogue. It would propose, based on what it saw, what it thought I liked. I would correct, confirm, cajole, and provide insight. Why yes, I am deeply interested in Philosophy. Actually no I’m not that interested in international finance, that one article happened to be really interesting.</p>
<p>Claude:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Governance and Legal Systems: Your reading suggests deep interest in specific governance mechanisms and legal frameworks beyond general institutional analysis. How central is this comparative approach to governance in your thinking?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Me:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I think I'm interested in how the world works, and how it could be made to work better. How do we build a better world, or at least minimize the chances of a worse world. I don't think I'm specifically interested in governance and legal systems outside of that context.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Claude:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There's a recurring pattern of interest in Philosophical Frameworks for analyzing complex issues. Would you consider this a hidden interest, or do you see it as simply an aspect of Rationality?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Me:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I am definitely interested in philosophy and philosophical frameworks. If I didn't need to "work for a living," I would strongly consider going back to school for a PhD in Philosophy. I think all of life's interesting questions are in the world of philosophy, and that it's a shame there's no way to make money doing it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At the end, I’d ask it to spit out an updated version of the rubric, which I would take to a new conversation with Claude, the next markdown file, and repeat the process. After the second round I asked it to provide me with a prompt that captured everything I was trying to do, which I used for all subsequent iterations of the conversation.</p>
<p>The output of all these rounds was a several-kilobyte markdown file which accurately captures some, but not all, of my various interests. Not all my interests are captured in the things I read, and a random sampling was always bound to miss something. Nevertheless it’s good for what it got!</p>
<p>If you think it’d be interesting to see the final result (either to see what we built, or to get a better sense of who I am as a person,) I’ll attach a lightly edited version at the end.</p>
<h2>Actually Doing the Thing, for Exceptionally Large Values of Thing</h2>
<p>Originally I was going to take my rubric and repurpose those scripts to have ChatGPT do the review, but I ran into a technical issue and had to pivot to Anthropic for this part. The ChatGPT batch API is convinced that I have batches in progress, even when I don’t and I can’t submit any more.</p>
<p>Anthropic ended up working out well because their API will let you set a “system” prompt that is distinct from the “user” prompt. The entire rubric and guidance on the return format went into the system prompt, and the user prompt ended up being the document data.</p>
<p>The first run, everything scored too high. Every document was a keeper, even ones I knew I didn’t want to keep.</p>
<p>I adjusted the rubric slightly, and it got a little better.</p>
<p>Finally, I added a point deduction metric for certain topics I knew I didn’t like, and that hit the sweet spot. The final run resulted in a markdown file reviewing everything in my Reader backlog that didn’t have highlights, and suggested around 83 deletions.</p>
<p>I manually reviewed all suggested deletions, and agreed with all but one of them, which revealed an obvious gap in the rubric. Success! The “keeps” were lightly spot-checked. I don’t need it to be absolutely right about them, because the worst case there is that a future step of this project costs me a little extra money by doing enrichment on a document that has nothing of value to give. I’m not that worried about it.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>So what I did I learn? I learned a lot about how batch jobs to OpenAI and Anthropic work. I learned a medium amount about my own interests. I feel like if I had any need to do it I could write an extremely good dating profile now. “Enjoys long walks in the forest and applied epistemology.” I learned a bit more about how to wrangle the best results out of the current state of LLMs.</p>
<p>My next steps are to take everything I learned and built and begin working on the enrichment pipeline, which I think will look pretty similar in a lot of ways to start. Because I first need to deal with my archive, batch jobs are the most cost effective option. Eventually I’m imagining an AWS Step Function. All of which is better than Ghostreader. Most of which is better than nothing.</p>
<p>Did this help me find my Roman Empire? Well, no. As far as I can tell that’s well and truly gone. But I think it’s improving the process by which I never let the Empire fall again.</p>

<h2>Scoring Methodology</h2>
<p>This rubric uses a point-based system with both positive criteria and penalties:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Calculate Positive Points</strong>: First, add all points from the Core Criteria (0-70 possible) and Bonus Criteria (0-30 possible) sections based on the document's strengths.</li>
<li><strong>Apply Penalties</strong>: Next, subtract any applicable penalty points from the Topics to Avoid (-75 points per topic) or Content to Approach with Caution (-15 to -25 points per category) sections.</li>
<li><strong>Determine Final Score</strong>: The resulting total represents the document's final score, which should be evaluated against the Final Score Interpretation scale.</li>
<li><strong>Decision Rule</strong>: Documents scoring below 50 points after all calculations should be discarded, regardless of their initial positive score.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Final Score Interpretation</h2>
<ul>
<li>90‑100: Exceptionally interesting – drop everything to read and deeply engage</li>
<li>75‑89: Highly interesting – worth dedicated time and attention</li>
<li>60‑74: Quite interesting – worth reading completely</li>
<li>50‑59: Moderately interesting – skim for valuable sections</li>
<li><strong>Discard threshold (below 50 points)</strong></li>
</ul>
<h2>Topics to Track</h2>
<p>This section captures nascent topics that have appeared in my reading but haven't yet accumulated enough evidence to warrant promotion to core interests. Items here have typically appeared in 1-2 documents that resonated with me but don't yet demonstrate consistent engagement across multiple sources.</p>
<p>I track these topics to identify patterns in my evolving interests. When I notice multiple high-quality pieces related to the same tracked topic over time, this signals a potential new core interest emerging. This approach helps me recognize genuine shifts in my intellectual focus rather than temporary curiosities.</p>
<p>Each topic below represents a potential direction for future exploration that has shown some initial promise. They remain in this "waiting room" until sufficient evidence accumulates to justify promotion to a core interest.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cognitive Optimization & Attention</strong> – techniques and states (from memory systems to contemplative practice) that enhance mental performance or regulate focus.</li>
<li><strong>Leadership & Creative Practice</strong> – skill-building for high-leverage roles and sustainable creative careers that hasn’t yet folded into the Core “Creative Process & Productivity” interest.</li>
<li><strong>Tech-Futures Ethics & Governance</strong> – long-term thinking and moral analysis around emerging technologies, genetic selection, and far-future scenarios.</li>
<li><strong>AI Dynamics</strong> – surprising or little-understood emergent behaviors in AI systems that sit adjacent to, but aren’t yet central within, the AI Core Interest.</li>
<li><strong>Infrastructure Resilience & Security</strong> – systemic approaches to keeping physical and digital infrastructure robust against failure or attack.</li>
<li><strong>Public Systems & Policy Design</strong> – complex-systems views on public-health policy, regulation, and institutional architecture (distinct from day-to-day partisan politics).</li>
<li><strong>Culture, Language & Society</strong> – anthropological lenses on technology plus linguistic and cognitive diversity research that reveal how culture shapes thought.</li>
<li><strong>Open Web & Digital Commons</strong> – governance, sustainability, and advocacy for shared digital resources and open platforms.</li>
<li><strong>Game Facilitation</strong> – psychology and techniques for running engaging tabletop or live-action games; supports (but isn’t yet promoted into) the Role-Playing Games Core Interest.</li>
<li><strong>RPG Mechanics Innovation</strong> - Novel approaches to traditional tabletop systems that solve common gameplay issues or create new player experiences.</li>
</ul>

			 <p>Somewhere around five years ago I briefly entertained the idea that I was very seriously going to attempt to be an author. During that time I approached this the way I approach everything: with my whole entire ass.</p>
<p><em>Why half-ass anything when you can whole-ass one thing?</em></p>
<p>Which meant that, among other things, I read a lot of books on how to do writing good. Also, I tried to practice doing writing good.</p>
<p>The following are two bits of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flash_fiction">flash fiction</a> that I wrote for practice.</p>

<p>Kazrin felt the thrum of his dirigible&rsquo;s turbines through the wheel as he strained to guide his ship against strong chronomantic headwinds. Three days out from port, four more to the capital city, and nowhere to stop in between.</p>
<p>A symphony of lights erupted from the console in front of him. &ldquo;Not again.&rdquo; The thrum got weaker as the ship listed helplessly further to the port side. He slapped a heavy gloved hand against the wall while bellowing some of his juiciest curses. For a brief moment the turbine rumbled back to life, but quickly died taking the rest of the engines with it.</p>
<p>More choice words as the pilot flailed behind his seat looking for something, anything. He grasped at the jungle of cables full of various fluids and gasses. One of the tubes moved as he knew it shouldn&rsquo;t. Kazrin grasped, wriggled, and finally slammed it back into place. The turbines roared back to life.</p>
<p>Only four more days to go. A warm meal. A warm bed. There&rsquo;d be plenty of time once his work was done. For now, he was satisfied to be heading in the right direction.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="the-underthing">The Underthing</h2>
<p>Cold aethermantic resin dripped from the tunnel ceiling on to Alex&rsquo;s head as he traced his finger over the brass pipe schematic. Ruined parts were strewn around him, not a single one had fit. &ldquo;Lazy horking engineers never updating documentation,&rdquo; he cursed out loud. &ldquo;Kim valve&rdquo; the useless flow-chart indicated, &ldquo;model 703.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Alex pressed his last 703 into the indicated ports, connections snapping into place with a satisfying click. Several pressure dials started to rise in an encouraging manner indicating positive resin flow. A great gout of fluid burst through the middle of the device, gauges falling back to their zero readings and covered him in even more of the viscous goo. Great, now he was out of Kim valves and he smelled like a cheeseburger went dancing on a hot summer day.</p>
<p>He pulled out the ruptured 703 and tossed it on the growing pile, then examined his parts bag critically. No more 703s, but a rusty Alice 417 and a Stanley 286. Out of better options to try he jammed the 417 into one side and the 286 in the other, then pressed the two parts together. They didn&rsquo;t quite fit, but a few wraps of luminescent green fibertape and maybe? Almost? The pressure gauges ticked up and the tape held.</p>
<p>The sound of resin flowing was music to Alex&rsquo;s ears. Fifteen years in the tunnels and it never stopped sounding sweet. He gathered up his tools and set off, there would be many more leaks to fix before the day was done.</p>

			 <p>I wanted to try something new this week and give an end-of-week status report. No idea if this is something I’ll keep doing, but the best way to figure out if it’s useful (to me or anyone else) is to give it a try.</p>
<p>The majority of this week has been spent working on the website for WizardHQ, a project that all my friends know about, but if you don’t know me personally this is the first time you’re hearing about it. I don’t intend to try to advertise it at this exact moment, please excuse me being vague for now. More to come on that in the next few weeks, but for right now it’s eating up a considerable amount of time.</p>
<p>Last week I crawled the <a href="https://thewizardly.com/2025/03/27/my-project-for-the-evening.html">TTRPG thought space</a> and that gave me the idea that maybe I could build a small search engine to do this. “Small” is doing a lot of lifting there. But I think it might be a useful community service to crawl the TTRPG blogosphere and make that easy for people to search. It’s a win-win. Discoverability for small creators, ease of finding for players and GMs.</p>
<p>I spent time during one of my lunch breaks and got the bones of a crawler written. None of the “crawl more links” parts, but I can point it at a single page and get all the needfuls from it. Tested against my own blog, not sure how much further it’d need to go to work against other sites.</p>
<p>Not sure if that project will go further, I’ve been dithering. I think to do anything with it implies setting aside one or two of my other TTRPG projects, which didn’t get any progress this week because WizardHQ exploded all over my original plan.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://thewizardly.com/2025/04/03/an-update-on-this-years/">An update on this year’s Theme</a></h1>
		

		<a href="https://thewizardly.com/2025/04/03/an-update-on-this-years/" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2025-04-03 19:14:17 -0500">Apr 3, 2025</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>We’re a couple days over one quarter of the way into the year, so I sat down and worked on a template for planning around my yearly theme.</p>
<p>Part of a yearly theme is not to plan too hard. There’s a reason it’s not a yearly goal or, so help me, new years resolution. But I thought having some sort of light framework for checkin and intention setting would be useful, so that’s what I’m working towards.</p>
<p>Here’s what I’ve got.</p>
<h2>1. What Does This Theme Mean to Me Right Now?</h2>
<ul>
<li>Right now, today, I'm focusing on "do we have enough" in the sense of food to carry us through the uncertain times ahead. Even if shortages are not a concern, I think prices are likely to skyrocket, and the more I can insulate us from that the better off we'll be.</li>
<li>When I originally wrote this theme I was thinking about "enough" in the sense of things I often had too much of. I have too many things to do. I eat too much. I spend too much money. I buy too many things.</li>
<li>I think "enough" can be seen from both sides, or a right-sizing of things. Neither too little nor too much, broadly, across all categories in my life.</li>
</ul>
<h2>2. What Am I Exploring with This Theme?</h2>
<ul>
<li>How do I know that I have enough?</li>
<li>How do I add a circuit-breaker to that part of me that gets excited and jumps at opportunities to consider whether I already have enough?</li>
<li>How do I release things when I have too much?</li>
</ul>
<h2>3. What Does “more aligned” Vs. “less aligned” Look Like?</h2>
<p><strong>More aligned with the theme:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Depth over breadth.</li>
<li>Saying no.</li>
<li>Thoughtful consumption.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Less aligned with the theme:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Buying things just to have.</li>
<li>Trying to do everything.</li>
<li>Avoiding hard trade-offs.</li>
</ul>
<h2>4. How Might This Theme Show up in Different Areas of Life?</h2>
<p><strong>Work</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Delegating more, actioning less.</li>
<li>Having energy and focus to spare.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Relationships</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>More, deeper connections with highly-aligned people.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Health</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>"Eat not to dullness and drink not to elevation." - Benjamin Franklin</li>
<li>Enough rest. More than I think I need. Rest before it becomes obvious I needed to.</li>
<li>Build sustainable systems.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Time</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Live by the schedule so that free time can be truly free.</li>
<li>Waste no time. Leisure is a valid activity, and should be engaged with by design.</li>
<li>Anything that wants to pay me for my time, or worse, that I pay for with my time, should be considered anathema.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Environment</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Bring nothing home that has no place to live.</li>
<li>Find the things which no longer spark joy and let them go.</li>
</ul>
<h2>5. Integration Reminders</h2>
<ul>
<li>What would <em>enough</em> look like this week?</li>
<li>Where am I doing <em>enough</em> to move my goals forward?</li>
<li>Where am I doing <em>too much</em> in unhelpful ways?</li>
<li>What could I let go?</li>
</ul>

			<h1><a href="https://thewizardly.com/2025/03/27/a-journey-into-ttrpg-thoughtspace/">A Journey into TTRPG Thoughtspace</a></h1>
		

		<a href="https://thewizardly.com/2025/03/27/a-journey-into-ttrpg-thoughtspace/" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2025-03-27 20:37:07 -0500">Mar 27, 2025</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>It’s funny. The genesis of my gigantic TTRPG collection (almost certainly 500+ distinct books) was an old newsletter I used to write. I won’t link to it. It’s super defunct.</p>
<p>But I thought, a hundred years ago, that there was a place in the world for someone to dig through these old games and find the best of their old ideas. Dust them off. Set them out on the table and see if anyone liked them.</p>
<p>Which is of course a brilliant idea that people smarter than me have been doing for more than 20 years now. Oh well!</p>
<p>And for better or worse, my life took a different turn and that’s not what ended up happening. But over time, as the collection has grown, I continue to think that I might really enjoy making a TTRPG of my own.</p>
<p>Knowing full well there’s basically no money in it. Certainly less than I make doing <em>redacted</em> for <em>redacted</em>. Call it a passion project. A sickness. A warped twisting of a dark mind filled to the brim with moths and soup.</p>
<p>But long before it would ever make sense to sit down and do that thing, I would need to find my community. A thought that, somehow, never occurred to me to try to do. Until like a couple weeks ago.</p>
<h2>And so it begins...</h2>
<p>I was, until about two weeks ago, following a grand total of maybe four TTRPG-related blogs. Come to think of it I’m not even sure when that started.</p>
<p>Tonight, I fixed that. My project for the evening has been to trace the hidden veins of the TTRPG thought space, find all the blogs I wasn’t reading, and add them to my reader.</p>
<p>My process was simple. Starting at the blog that’s been reliably the <a href="https://knightattheopera.blogspot.com/">most interesting</a> I would spiral out, following link after link, adding whatever caught my attention. Whether it was a single post to Readwise, or the entire feed.</p>
<p>Dear reader, I now have <strong>113</strong> unread articles in my feed. It was none on Monday. Oh the hubris of one week ago me thinking I might not have anything to read on my next flight.</p>
<p>I should probably be surprised, or ashamed, or <em>surpshramed</em> at how little I’d engaged with the TTRPG community. There’s no excuse for it. For something I claim to care so much about, I had invested so little. Except for the literal investment. In money. Of buying 500+ TTRPG books.</p>
<p>But as they say, it’s really the friends we made along the way.</p>
<h2>... And I had made none.</h2>
<p>It’s always difficult to introspect the self, and figure out why past-me did or didn’t do anything. I hardly know what now-me is doing and future-me is a radioactive orb of soup and malice.</p>
<p>But I think the main reason I was living on an island was a secret fear that I might... I dunno. Read something and then be influenced by it? It’s ridiculous on the face of it. That’s literally the reason I bought all the RPG books.</p>
<p>You see if I don’t know what all the cool kids with their hip new <a href="https://www.tuesdayknightgames.com/pages/mothership-rpg">Motherships</a> and <a href="https://www.hauntedtable.games/">Triangle Agencies</a> are doing, then how could I ever be guilty of <em>copying</em> them? I couldn’t. Infallible logic. Your move Aliens.</p>
<p>This is of course insane.</p>
<p>If there’s one thing I’ve learned about plagiarism, it’s that the first step is to <em>plagiarize</em> something. I’m not the kind of person who would copy someone else’s work and then try to pass it off as my own. (Well. Okay. I did do that once, in first grade. I “borrowed” someone else’s addition worksheet, because I hated math, erased their name, and put my own. Yes this is a true story. But I promise I don’t do that anymore.)</p>
<p>Two people can independently have the same idea, or be inspired by the same thing, and maybe end up in the same neighborhood as each other, and that’s okay. Some people might try to claim one copied the other and those people are Wrong and should be put in Time Jail where they will be sat on by the Universe for all of Eternity or until they Feel Bad.</p>
<p>Basically, this is not a thing I should be worrying about. If someone wants to make the legal claim I plagiarized them, then it’s time for lawyers to have a Polite Conversation about it. Until then, I’m not spending my time worrying what some rando on the internet thinks about the provenance of the art I’m trying to make.</p>
<h2>Okay so then what?</h2>
<p>Arguably, I should post more of my ideas on the internet. Part of that is because it’d be proof I had them first, but that’s a silly reason to do anything. Don’t spend your life fighting the argument against some future internet nerd with a Bad Opinion. Mainly because ideas are worthless and you should give them away for free anyway.</p>
<p>Execution is the part that matters.</p>
<p>Our society puts so-called “Idea Men” up on a pillar because it’s tactically useful to have a class of person who thinks their Next Big Idea is finally going to make them rich, while ignoring all the social and structural reasons it won’t. Ideas don’t make people rich. Working 16 hour days and a small $2million loan from your parents make people rich. The idea was secondary.</p>
<p>The problem isn’t that I don’t want to do that. It’s that writing a TTRPG, or a setting for a TTRPG, is about the fifth thing down my project list. No. Really.</p>
<ul>
<li>That wizard community thing I keep hinting at.</li>
<li>A SaaS app for exactly ten people that I cherish.</li>
<li>This thing I’m calling the ORB which I am envisioning would sort of be like a digital museum exhibit for all of my classic TTRPGs and their ephemera.</li>
<li>A SaaS app that might actually have a paying audience.</li>
<li>Project Ashenreach. The codename for my TTRPG setting.</li>
</ul>
<p>See? Fifth.</p>
<p>If you’re curious, I’m tracking 30 distinct projects in my project management system. A perfectly normal and well-adjusted number of projects for an adult human to have.</p>
<p>Until then I’m following 23 distinct TTRPG-related blogs. I’m sure that number will thin over time. But it’s the start of actually trying to be present and aware. Of weaving myself into the fabric of a community that is ostensibly important to me.</p>
<p>Someday, probably not soon, I’ll try to reach out to some of them and say hello. Make friends. With the other people crazy enough to do what I too also want to do. Someday.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>My thoughts on working with AI have evolved a lot over the last year or so that I’ve been actively using them. </p>
<p>I’ve gone from “this is an interesting toy, but it doesn’t seem very useful” to “wow, people are using this all the time and it gets important things wrong” to “actually if you’re smart about how you use it this can do some really useful things” to “I’m using this more and more every day, it seems unlikely that’s going to change.”</p>
<p>Now I can see more and more of the places where not using AI, at least a little, is hurting me. Or at least slowing me down. In some cases that’s fine. I’m typing this by hand right now, and I know Claude could probably do it in about 7 seconds from a bulleted list of the points I want to make. The end result might even be better, in the sense that Claude is generally better at making easy-to-read content than I am.</p>
<p>I type like I speak, and I speak like a college professor. That’s not meant to be a good thing. But it is what it is and it’s who I am.</p>
<p>All that being said, I think I need to revisit my “100% Human Generated” policy. It’s still true, at least as of the time I’m writing this, but I think I’m missing out on an opportunity to at least collaborate with the machine. The sentiment that went into that policy is still absolutely core to my position: this blog is a craft to be honed, not a task to be automated.</p>
<p>I gave a version of these thoughts to Claude, and asked it to help me craft a new policy. Over several rounds of iteration, fixing parts I didn’t like and mulling over suggestions I hadn’t considered, we arrived at something that I think represents a better way to handle the challenges I’m facing.</p>
<h2>Human-Led, Collaborative Content Policy</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>This blog remains fundamentally human-driven. All topics, ideas, and creative direction come from my own artistic sensibility and experiences. I sometimes collaborate with AI language models in my creative process, similar to working with a thoughtful writing partner who helps me refine and articulate my ideas.</p>
<p>When and How I Collaborate with AI:</p>
<ul>
<li>Refinement and focus: Sometimes I share my rough thoughts with an AI to help extract key ideas or sharpen my message</li>
<li>Editorial dialogue: AI might help me restructure or clarify my existing ideas</li>
<li>Creative exploration: Occasionally, through conversation with AI, we develop phrasings or explanations that effectively capture what I wanted to express</li>
</ul>
<p>What Remains Purely Human:</p>
<ul>
<li>All topic choices and creative direction</li>
<li>The initial ideas and perspectives being expressed</li>
<li>The decision of what to publish and when</li>
<li>The overall voice and style of the blog</li>
</ul>
<p>Transparency:
When I collaborate with AI on a post in any substantial way, I'll acknowledge that collaboration and specify which AI I worked with. I believe in being honest about the role AI plays in my creative process while maintaining my commitment to human creativity and authentic expression.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As mentioned previously, I worked on Claude with that. Claude Sonnet 3.5 to be precise, although I think in general I’m not going to specify exact versions. That gets into the weeds, and is also somewhat meaningless with how the frontier labs routinely update their models in meaningful ways without updating the name.</p>
<p>I’m curious to see what people think about this new policy. I’m open to feedback before formally enacting it. Am I making some kind of huge tactical error by letting AI into my workflow? Are there things I should be drawing a line on that I’m neglecting entirely?</p>
<p>Let me know.</p>

<p>“What a week, huh?”</p>
<p>“Lemon, it’s Wednesday.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>— <cite>30 Rock, S4E2 “Into the Crevasse”</cite></p>
<p>Without exception, the smartest people I know are all in agreement that Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) is on the way in the next three years. That could mean a lot of things. Good things. Bad things. I think it’s reasonable to assume nobody can predict what the world will look like beyond that horizon.</p>
<p>Kurzweil’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Singularity_Is_Near">Singularity</a> is finally near.</p>
<p>Let me be clear: the Singularity is the moment beyond which we cannot imagine the future, because it is entirely different from the world we have always known. Dear gentle reader, I think that point is not more than a year or two from now.</p>
<p>But I’m not here to talk about AI or AGI or the Singularity, because that’s one way in which I think people are right to be worried. There’s the part where technocratic oligarchs have bought what remains of the American government, citizens are being deported to Guantanamo Bay, and airplanes are <a href="https://apnews.com/article/philadelphia-plane-crash-medical-transport-8617dab53471190832dd73db149489fa">falling</a> out <a href="https://apnews.com/live/dc-plane-crash-reagan-updates">of the sky</a>.</p>
<p>The bad news keeps rolling in, and I think it’s reasonable to expect that it gets worse from here.</p>
<p>There will never come a point where the red tribe will wake up and realize “oh no, this isn’t what I voted for.” This <em>is</em> what they voted for.</p>
<p>I know you desperately yearn for a “leopards ate my face” style realization of the atrocities they’ve caused. Will continue to cause. Are actively rejoicing in causing. That is not coming, and I need you to stop investing energy in waiting for it. There is work to be done.</p>
<p>If you’ll permit me a crumb of silliness in this tryin’ time, I’d like to present a framework that may help you figure out how you can help when everything feels hopeless, when it feels like the world is crumbling.</p>
<p>Please select from one of the following four class options:</p>
<p><strong>Blanche</strong>: Charming, debonair, slutty. First in line to shank a bitch out back the Waffle House at 3 AM if they even glance at one of her homies.</p>
<p><strong>Sophia</strong>: Wise, sardonic, unstoppable. A force of nature in the Greek God sort of way. Could correct Peter Jackson on what it sounds like when you stab someone in the lung.</p>
<p><strong>Dorothy</strong>: Intelligent, charismatic, truth to power. Plans on plans on plans. Why do physical violence when emotional violence works as good at half the price?</p>
<p><strong>Rose</strong>: St Olaf Stories as a finesse weapon. Emotional support  friend. Can a cheesecake be a familiar? Have some cheesecake. I SAID HAVE SOME CHEESECAKE.</p>
<p>Look. I know it’s hard. But you need to figure out what you can do to help. Even if that’s taking care of yourself today so that you’re here to fight tomorrow.</p>
<p>It’s deeply unfair that we are called upon to fight this battle. Nevertheless, you are called. Nevertheless, you must fight.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, you must persist.</p>

			 <img class="pure-img" src="https://thewizardly.com/uploads/2024/medical-roundup-1.png" alt="If you have an unhealthy relationship to food, fixing it is (usually, for most people, myself included) not a matter of ‘eat like a healthy person,’ the same way an alcoholic can’t drink like a normal person. You have to do something far more intentional and deliberate, more absolute, more costly, and do it constantly forever. - TheZvi in Medical Roundup #1">
<hr>
<p>I believe it was roughly around this time of the year, several hundred years ago, third or fourth grade to be imprecise, that I declared in no uncertain terms that new years resolutions were stupid, and I would not be doing them.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve met me, that anecdote probably doesn&rsquo;t seem very surprising. Yes, I was always like this. No, I won&rsquo;t elaborate.</p>
<p>The reason I bring it up is that I&rsquo;m about to talk about what to many people would in fact sound like a new year&rsquo;s resolution, but is prompted approximately zero percent by the new year and entirely by the trip to Disney World staring me down from approximately two weeks in the future which I am clearly, woefully, physically unprepared for. No doubt I&rsquo;ll still have an amazing time, but I can tell before I even catch my flight that some things are going to need to change.</p>
<p>Currently I weigh somewhere between &ldquo;can walk up a flight of stairs without stopping&rdquo; and &ldquo;sir you won&rsquo;t be able to ride this ride today.&rdquo; I don&rsquo;t always need a seat belt extender when I fly, but sometimes I do. I&rsquo;ve weighed more, I&rsquo;ve weighed less, but as I get older it&rsquo;s becoming more of an issue in more ways, and something clearly has to be done. As a close friend once said, &ldquo;you can be old, or you can be fat.&rdquo; He was speaking from a position of authority and wisdom.</p>
<p>Like most fat people, I&rsquo;ve already tried everything. Everything. Whatever you&rsquo;re thinking, I&rsquo;ve tried it. From &ldquo;eat less, move more&rdquo; to Keto, to GLP-1 agonists. Some things worked for a while, then stopped working. Some things never worked. Nothing worked indefinitely. The things that worked the best required persistent, ongoing, considerable discipline. I suspect any system that will succeed for me will have that feature, and the challenge will be convincing everyone to arrange my life around it. You can only get away with being so weird if you want to succeed by normal definitions of success, and I&rsquo;m not Steve Jobs enough for abnormal definitions of success.</p>
<p>So this post is somewhat of a manifesto. It is, in part, an attempt to document the things I am going to attempt to start doing because I think they&rsquo;ll help. It is also, in part, to justify the weirdness I will need to introduce into my life and the lives of others to improve my likelihood of success. It is, if nothing else, an attempt to be legible.</p>
<h2 id="part-1---food">Part 1 - Food</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;The real importance of the ‘never’ list is that you have to make a commitment that there are some things in your life that you’re going to give up and you’re never going to have again. And there’s not a diet that I know of that ever said, ‘You know what? You’re going to say goodbye to some things forever.’ I actually think that’s important because it’s a symbolic life change that says ‘I’m turning a corner.’ It’s a statement of ‘I’m making a permanent change.’ That’s important from both a psychological and nutritional standpoint.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em>- Alton Brown</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In 2010&rsquo;s &ldquo;Live and Let Diet&rdquo; Alton Brown, host and creator of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_Eats">Good Eats</a>, introduced what he called the &ldquo;System of Four Lists&rdquo; &ndash; effectively, a contract with himself that helped Brown build and maintain a 50lb weight loss. Each list was designed to either encourage good food choices, or discourage bad ones.</p>
<p>The first list was comprised of things he decided he must eat every day:</p>
<ul>
<li>Leafy greens</li>
<li>Nuts</li>
<li>Carrots</li>
<li>Green tea</li>
<li>Whole grains</li>
<li>Fruits</li>
</ul>
<p>As I understand it, the purpose of focusing on things he must have rather than things he couldn&rsquo;t have, was to flood the playing field with good food. To leave less room for things that didn&rsquo;t support his desired health outcomes. Instead of focusing on restriction as the primary goal, to focus on nutrition to the exclusion of problematic foods.</p>
<p>The second list are things he needed to eat at least three times a week:</p>
<ul>
<li>Yogurt</li>
<li>Broccoli / Cauliflower</li>
<li>Sweet potato</li>
<li>Avocado</li>
<li>Oily fish</li>
<li>Tofu</li>
</ul>
<p>Restriction enters the picture in his third list, the things he can only have once a week. Effectively, the treats:</p>
<ul>
<li>Red meat</li>
<li>White starch</li>
<li>Desserts</li>
<li>Alcohol</li>
</ul>
<p>In the original version of Live and Let Diet that aired, white starch was &ldquo;pasta,&rdquo; but in articles published later online it appears that he broadened it. My guess is by white starch what he really means is everything I think of as &ldquo;sugar.&rdquo; I have a notoriously broad definition of sugar, which extends pretty much all the way to all purpose flour. Any refined carbohydrate. So all breads are sugar, but a baked potato is not. Maybe he intended to include baked potatoes in his white starch category, I don&rsquo;t know. I think my problem probably isn&rsquo;t the number of baked potatoes I eat.</p>
<p>Finally, the &ldquo;never&rdquo; list. The things he had to give up for good:</p>
<ul>
<li>Soda</li>
<li>Processed meals</li>
<li>Canned soups</li>
<li>&ldquo;Diet&rdquo; anything</li>
<li>Fast food</li>
</ul>
<p>That seems clearly and objectively correct to me. There goes my chances of getting a Taco <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell-shaped_function">Icosahedron</a> sponsorship, but I think that&rsquo;s probably a risk I&rsquo;m willing to take.</p>
<p>Let me say that I really like this approach. I like the idea of filling up on healthy &ldquo;must haves&rdquo; to edge out less healthy alternatives. I like the idea of allowing a little fun as a once a week treat. I even like the idea of saying &ldquo;never&rdquo; to the things we all know are bad. There&rsquo;s power in never. Never reduces the option space, it removes an entire class of negotiation from the table. &ldquo;No&rdquo; is the most powerful word in the English language, and a complete sentence.</p>
<p>My smart move is probably to take this, exactly as written, and try it for a month before I make any adjustments. And I think that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m going to aim to do. Just for the sake of completeness though, here are the adjustments I&rsquo;m considering:</p>
<ul>
<li>Carrots are fine, but I&rsquo;m not a huge fan and I just can&rsquo;t think of how I&rsquo;d manage to fit them in every day without getting sick of them.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;m not a huge tea drinker, green or otherwise, but I&rsquo;m game to try. I don&rsquo;t like hot beverages, but I think tea might be my best opportunity for replacing soda.</li>
</ul>
<p>That&rsquo;s it. Those are the changes I think I&rsquo;d want to make. But, let&rsquo;s give it an honest try first.</p>
<p>&hellip; After I get back from Disney. Because it&rsquo;s only a couple weeks away, because the food at Disney is part of the appeal, and because it provides a break point to clear out my kitchen and refresh anew.</p>
<h2 id="part-2---activity">Part 2 - Activity</h2>
<p>In October&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.relay.fm/cortex/148">State of the Apps</a> CGP Grey talked about <a href="https://www.whoop.com/us/en/">Whoop</a> and the extent to which the data it provided was a &ldquo;game changer&rdquo; for his health journey. I bought one immediately. Well. Rented. Their business model is to give you the device on pain of subscription. I&rsquo;ve been wearing it for over a month now, and its data collection is pretty impressive.</p>
<p>With a month of basically &ldquo;normal&rdquo; baseline data, it has a good sense of how healthy I am (or am not,) and suggests some reasonable goals:</p>
<ul>
<li>More steps</li>
<li>Better sleep</li>
<li>Exercise a couple times a week</li>
<li>Avoid added sugar</li>
<li>Drink water</li>
</ul>
<p>Which, really, seems like very milquetoast advice. What&rsquo;s important is that it can mostly track those automatically, and suggest realistic goals based on how I&rsquo;m actually doing. Next week, for example, I&rsquo;m going to aim for 6600+ steps per day, a sleep consistency of 70%+, any exercise at least two days, no added sugar at least five days, and meeting my hydration goal at least five days. Then at the end of the week I&rsquo;ll review, adjust as necessary, and try again. Unlike the food plan, this starts immediately. Although I can&rsquo;t promise I&rsquo;ll avoid added sugar at Disney. Because Dole Whip.</p>
<p>All of these systems, together, I&rsquo;m calling my Health Operating System. Like any other OS, I&rsquo;m sure they&rsquo;ll need patching and updates from time to time, but I&rsquo;m broadcasting it wide so that everyone who has to deal with me knows what&rsquo;s what. These are the things I&rsquo;m choosing to prioritize, and the rules I&rsquo;m willing to be inconvenient to maintain. Apologies in advance.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Every December my partner and I make the drive down to the Warhammer Citadel in Grapevine, TX to play our end-of-year game. If you&rsquo;re a fan of Warhammer but have never been to the Citadel, imagine a Games Workshop or Warhammer store that&rsquo;s also a coffee shop. It&rsquo;s the closest thing we have in North America to <a href="https://warhammerworld.warhammer-community.com/explore-warhammer-world/">Warhammer World</a>, but it&rsquo;s closer to a normal Warhammer store than that statement might imply.</p>
<p>Still, as the North American headquarters for Games Workshop, it has the benefit of being fully stocked with even the rare and unusual games, lots of well-painted minis on display, and probably 20 open tables in the back. It&rsquo;s worth a trip if you&rsquo;re in town, but not a trip to town if that makes sense. But I digress.</p>
<p>At the start of 2024 we determined to play a full 2000 point game, my <a href="https://warhammer40k.fandom.com/wiki/Tyranids">Tyranids</a> vs his <a href="https://warhammer40k.fandom.com/wiki/Death_Guard">Death Guard</a>. Then my year exploded. Suddenly it was September and I didn&rsquo;t have a single painted model to show for it. What I did have, however, was almost all the <a href="https://warhammer40k.fandom.com/wiki/Necrons">Necrons</a> I&rsquo;d need for a Boarding Action. So we pivoted, and rather than try to rush 100+ unpainted models, I finished the roughly ~11 for our new goal.</p>
<p>The Necrons had been a previous year&rsquo;s army of the year, so I have a decent set of them in various states of completion, and we were big fans of Boarding Actions which came out around the transition from 9th to 10th edition Warhammer, so this was a delightful return to form.</p>
<p>So, how did it go?</p>
<h3 id="before-the-battle">Before the Battle</h3>
<p>In the current edition of Warhammer you determine who goes first by rolling a six-sided die (d6,) and whoever rolls higher goes first. That person also picks who is the &ldquo;attacker&rdquo; and who is the &ldquo;defender.&rdquo; The attacker and defender have different deployment zones, places where they can put their minis on the table at the start of the game, and the defender has to put their minis down first. It&rsquo;s useful to be able to go second in the deployment phase, because where your opponent puts their minis tells you something about their strategy and can allow you to make last-minute strategic decisions about how to respond.</p>
<p>I won the roll-off, which meant that I would get to go first, and I chose to be the attacker, which meant that I got to deploy second.</p>
<p>We each held one unit in reserve to be deployed through strategic shenanigans later. He had a unit of <a href="https://www.warhammer.com/en-US/shop/Death-Guard-Poxwalkers-2021">Poxwalkers</a> that he could deep strike (place anywhere on the table that was at least 9&quot; away from one of my models,) through the usage of a limited resource called Command Points. I had a unit of <a href="https://www.warhammer.com/en-US/shop/Ophydian-Destroyers-2020">Ophydian Destroyers</a> that have deep strike as a natural ability.</p>
<p>A few more units were held in reserve to come in through the normal deployment mechanism, because Boarding Actions allows a limited number of units to be in the deployment zones each round.</p>
<h3 id="round-1">Round 1</h3>
<img class="pure-img" src="https://thewizardly.com/uploads/2024/img-1005.jpeg" alt="This image shows a Warhammer 40,000 tabletop game in progress, viewed from above. The battlefield is set up with reddish-brown modular walls creating a maze-like pattern of corridors and rooms across a dark gaming board. The board itself features detailed circuit-like patterns, and the walls are connected by turquoise decorative elements at their intersections. Several groups of painted miniature figures are positioned around the board, representing different armies with distinct color schemes - some darker units and some in yellower tones. A few yellow objective markers are scattered across the battlefield, and gaming accessories like a water bottle and small containers for dice or tokens can be seen at the board's edges.">
<p>During my turn I advanced my unit of <a href="https://www.warhammer.com/en-US/shop/Necrons-Flayed-Ones-2021">Flayed Ones</a>, one unit of <a href="https://www.warhammer.com/en-US/shop/Necron-Warriors-2020">Warriors</a> and my <a href="https://www.warhammer.com/en-US/shop/necrons-royal-warden-2023">Royal Warden</a> towards the central objective. The Royal Warden was my Warlord, which I think is sort of an unusual choice. He&rsquo;s basically a slightly more powerful Warrior, and in the regular 40K rules he gives an attached unit of Warriors the ability to run away and shoot in the same turn. In Boarding Actions he shouldn&rsquo;t be able to do that, but as a house rule we decided that he could because it&rsquo;s flavorful, and we think in the spirit of what the rules intended.</p>
<p>In the Northwest corner I moved my unit of <a href="https://warhammer40k.fandom.com/wiki/Canoptek_Scarab">Scarabs</a> to claim the objective. We wouldn&rsquo;t figure out until round three that they had no objective control score, which meant they couldn&rsquo;t actually claim that objective for me. One of my lessons learned!</p>
<p>Finally, I moved my unit of <a href="https://www.warhammer.com/en-US/shop/Necron-Triarch-Praetorians-2020">Triarch Praetorians</a> to capture the objective in the Southwest corner.</p>
<p>On his turn Ash moved his unit of <a href="https://www.warhammer.com/en-US/shop/Chaos-Spawn-2016">Chaos Spawn</a> to claim the Northeast objective, then advanced his Poxwalkers and <a href="https://www.warhammer.com/en-US/shop/Death-Guard-Typhus-2020">Typhus</a> to open a hatchway into the southern corridor. This was his first major tactical mistake, as he forgot entirely to attempt to claim the Southeastern objective this round.</p>
<p>He repeated that strategy in the north with another unit of Poxwalkers and his <a href="https://www.warhammer.com/en-US/shop/Death-Guard-Scribbus-Wretch-2020">Tallyman</a>.</p>
<h3 id="round-2">Round 2</h3>
<img class="pure-img" src="https://thewizardly.com/uploads/2024/img-1006.jpeg" alt="In this updated view of the Warhammer 40k game, several changes are noticeable from the first image. The most obvious change is the positioning of the miniature units - there appears to have been significant movement of troops across the battlefield after the first round of play. The darker-colored units (which appear to be grey/metallic in tone) have advanced further into the maze-like corridor structure on the left side of the board, while the yellower-toned units are now more concentrated on the right side.">
<p>Seeing that Ash intended to make use of Hatchways to get into the Northern and Southern hallways, I redirected units in both of those directions. To the North I ran my Flayed Ones into his unit of Poxwalkers. It was an immediate and decisive victory for the Flayed Ones, who eradicated the entire unit in one combat while taking no wounds.</p>
<p>I deployed a unit of <a href="https://www.warhammer.com/en-US/shop/Necron-Lychguard-2020">Lychguard</a> to the South to block another unit of Poxwalkers who were attempting to head for the Southwest objective. This was strategically one of Ash&rsquo;s better trades. The Lychguard have a relatively small number of incredibly strong attacks. Overall they were probably the strongest units either of us had brought, and in a perfect world I would have run them directly into his warlord, Typhus. Because their attacks were so strong, any Poxwalker they hit was guaranteed to melt, but because they had so few attacks they could only take out a few each round.</p>
<p>Seeing his Chaos Spawn coming for the central objective, I deployed my Ophydian Destroyers via Deep Strike directly on to the central objective to both claim and protect it. It was clear to me that my relatively slow moving warriors weren&rsquo;t going to get there in time, and if he claimed it I&rsquo;d have trouble shifting him off.</p>
<p>During Ash&rsquo;s turn he ran the Chaos Spawn directly into my Ophydians, dealing two wounds which wasn&rsquo;t quite enough to take one down. In the trade, my Ophydians did six wounds back, fully 3/4 of the damage his unit could sustain, and removing one of the two Chaos Spawn models.</p>
<p>Using the stratagem &ldquo;The Dead Rise&rdquo; allowed him to deep strike his final unit of Poxwalkers into the far Northwest corner, aiming them for my poor solitary unit of Scarabs. However, they were unable to move on their first turn on the board.</p>
<p>A unit of cultists in each of the Northeast and Southeast corners claim both objectives for him, and spend the next term &ldquo;securing&rdquo; the objectives, which would allow them to remain under his control as the units continued to move away. I forgot this was something units could do, and that specifically only my Warriors could do it. I had built my list assuming I&rsquo;d need to keep a unit on each objective I wanted to hold, which is why the Scarabs continued to sit in the Northwest corner. Since part of his strategy was to try to claim one of my back field objectives, this was probably the right idea regardless.</p>
<h3 id="round-3">Round 3</h3>
<img class="pure-img" src="https://thewizardly.com/uploads/2024/img-1007.jpeg" alt="In this third image of the Warhammer 40k game, further tactical movements have occurred. The metallic/grey colored units on the left side have consolidated their position and appear to be engaging more directly with their opponents near the center of the board. Some of the yellow-toned units have moved into what appears to be a more defensive position on the right side of the board, particularly around a circular feature in the terrain. The overall battlefield structure remains unchanged, but the positioning of the armies suggests the battle has intensified around the central corridor area.">
<p>In the Southwest I advance one of my units of Warriors towards the objective, freeing up my Praetorians to advance to the center of the board. I knew that Typhus was headed that direction, and that they had a decent melee profile, so I wanted all of my best bruisers ready to hold the contest for the central objective.</p>
<p>To the North I had my Flayed Ones open the hatchway towards the Northwest objective, positioning them to rescue my Scarabs on the following turn.</p>
<p>On Ash&rsquo;s turn he managed to start making progress against a few of my units. One of his cultists got a lucky shot in the shooting phase and did the one wound needed to finish off one of my Ophydians. Poxwalkers continued to trade with my Lychguard in the south, taking one of them out as well. I also lost a Scarab to his risen Poxwalkers in the Northeast.</p>
<p>He sent Typhus directly into my unit of Warriors, hoping to take them out in a single round. Unfortunately, he only managed to kill two.</p>
<h3 id="round-4">Round 4</h3>
<img class="pure-img" src="https://thewizardly.com/uploads/2024/img-1008.jpeg" alt="In this fourth image of the game, the battle appears to have reached a critical point. The metallic/grey units and yellow-toned forces are now heavily engaged in the central corridor area of the board, with units from both sides clustered around the middle section. Some of the yellow forces have repositioned near the top of the board, while maintaining their presence around the circular feature on the right side.">
<p>If you&rsquo;re not familiar with the Necrons, they&rsquo;re basically ancient space-faring robotic Egyptians. Basically. And they have a couple interesting gimmicks, but probably the one they&rsquo;re most well-known for is the ability to reanimate in the middle of combat. So sometimes you think you&rsquo;ve killed them, and then they stand right back up, stick their thumb to their nose, and blow a raspberry. And by blow a raspberry I mean they shoot you dead with plasma weapons.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s what I did.</p>
<p>Now would be a good time to thank the dice, who were exceptionally kind to me this day. More than half of the models that Ash had managed to kill stood back up, including both the Ophydian and Lychguard from the previous round. This was not a good outcome for him. It was a great outcome for me.</p>
<p>In my movement phase I carefully arranged as many units as possible to be able to shoot at Typhus. The mission we were playing scored an extra 10 victory points for murdering the enemy Warlord. I got close to putting a wound on him a couple of times, and then my own Warlord, the Royal Warden actually managed to hit with six wounds. Exactly enough to kill Typhus. Both of Ash&rsquo;s saving throws failed, which should have killed Typhus, but he burned what remained of his precious command points to roll again and saved on the second attempt.</p>
<p>What the Royal Warden couldn&rsquo;t do, the Ophydian Destroyers certainly could, and in the fighting phase they marched right in and turned Typhus into a fine plague-flavored sashimi.</p>
<p>In the Northwest, my Flayed Ones came to the rescue of my Scarabs, and eradicated the Poxwalkers that were harassing them.</p>
<p>At this point, with almost all of his Poxwalkers defeated, his Warlord dead, and me in control of more than half the board with strong units he would be unlikely to defeat, Ash conceded.</p>
<p>I won 55 to 30.</p>
<img class="pure-img" src="https://thewizardly.com/uploads/2024/img-1009.jpeg" alt="In this fifth image, the central battle has intensified further. The metallic/grey units and yellow-toned forces remain heavily engaged in the middle of the board, with what appears to be the largest concentration of units so far in the central corridor area. There's been some movement of the metallic units on the left side of the board, with fewer units visible in that area compared to the previous image.">
<h3 id="my-learnings">My Learnings</h3>
<ul>
<li>Scarabs can’t claim objectives. They probably would have been most useful running ahead and opening a door for me. I have a bad habit of forgetting that the hatchways in Boarding Actions can open.</li>
<li>Lychguard are strong bruisers, but without many attacks do their best work against a single beefy target. I really wanted to get them stuck in against Typhus, but Ash did the right thing gumming them up with Poxwalkers.</li>
<li>Praetors didn’t get much of a chance to shine, and looking at their profile now I would probably be smart to trade them out for something with a more clearly defined role in the battle.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="ashs-learnings">Ash&rsquo;s Learnings</h3>
<ul>
<li>He intended to use the cultists to “sticky things and then die,” and the Poxwalkers were meant to gum me up. In practice, the cultists mostly never arrived to the battle. Probably they should have come out first and ranged ahead, so that the Poxwalkers would have had an easier time getting into position.</li>
<li>Typhus needs to be used more tactically, he’s not invincible. It came as a surprise when I killed him basically twice.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="final-thoughts">Final Thoughts</h3>
<p>This was the only game of Warhammer we played in 2024, which is a real shame. We both love it. It&rsquo;s arguably part of how we met. I like the structure of having a game at the end of the year to work towards, because if nothing else we know that one game will happen.</p>
<p>Next year we&rsquo;re focusing on Necromunda as our game of choice, which has much smaller armies (called gangs) than even Boarding Actions. I hope that by having a smaller painting commitment we&rsquo;ll be able to get into games sooner in the year, and our annual game next December will be the capstone of a campaign rather than the only game we play.</p>
<p>In closing, here is every one of his models my Necrons managed to take off the board. The real gift was the Poxwalkers we murdered along the way.</p>
<img class="pure-img" src="https://thewizardly.com/uploads/2024/img-1010.jpeg" alt="This image shows a close-up view of Warhammer 40k miniatures arranged on what appears to be a metal tray or container. In the background, there are approximately 20-25 infantry-sized models painted in a yellowish-green color scheme with various metallic and bright accent colors like turquoise and purple. In the foreground, there are three larger models on circular orange-tinted bases. These appear to be some type of alien creature models with pale flesh tones and distinctive tentacle or claw-like appendages. Two have reddish claws/tentacles, while the middle one features purple and blue tentacles. The models show detailed painting work, particularly in the blending of colors on the tentacles and the texture work on the bases.">

			 <p>The society I happen to have been born into is based on consumption. It tells me that my worth is measured in my economic contributions. That I will be judged by the clothes I wear, the car I drive, the establishments I frequent.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had enough. Generally. Broadly. And also, in some cases, specifically. In just about every way it makes sense to measure, I&rsquo;ve had enough.</p>
<p>I reject the premise. I rebuke thee. I cast thee out.</p>
<h1 id="the-year-of-enough">The Year of Enough</h1>
<p>So begins the Year of Enough, my next yearly theme. The astute may have noticed that it&rsquo;s technically still 2024, and that&rsquo;s true, but immaterial. Yearly themes need not align perfectly to arbitrary notions of time. What&rsquo;s important is that they are useful to the person undertaking them. Consider it another way I abjectly refuse to adhere to the role society would like me to play. This year, my year starts on December 1, 2024.</p>
<p>Anything worth starting is worth starting <strong>now</strong>. Not tomorrow. Not next year. Now. As the poet Yoda once said, &ldquo;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3-CpzZJl8w">do, or do not.</a>&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mechanically what does &ldquo;Year of Enough&rdquo; mean? At its core, it means no unplanned spending. Of money. Of time. Of effort. Of energy. I have enough. Enough material goods. Enough things to do. Enough recommendations. Enough.</p>
<p>The best yearly themes are conceptually simple, but deep. Enough lands right in that sweet spot. It applies to almost every category I could mention. Whatever it is I almost certainly have enough of it. In many cases I have too much. It works as a response to every exhortation. Enough.</p>
<p>What does this look like in practice? In many ways like a &ldquo;buy nothing&rdquo; year, with some notable exceptions. Travel and time spent with friends remain important to me, and I&rsquo;ll continue to prioritize those. I&rsquo;m not cancelling any of my planned trips. Some of those trips are to new and novel places, and may require me to buy some things to be appropriately prepared, and any necessary purchases along those lines are pre-approved.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s also some furniture for the house that I will need as the remodel completes, and that list has been specifically defined. A new chair. Accessories for an existing chair. The needfuls to complete the lounge, the hobby room, and the master bedroom.</p>
<p>Along those lines, replacing anything that breaks, home repairs, and consumables are all valid expenditures. I&rsquo;m not trying to live an ascetic life. Well. At least not yet. Maybe someday I&rsquo;ll go full-on recluse, but not today. &ldquo;Enough&rdquo; means no more of the things I&rsquo;m already sated on. It doesn&rsquo;t mean suffering through obvious deficiencies.</p>
<p>This means that, among other things, I am no longer accepting recommendations. For shows to watch, movies to see, music to listen to. One category already bursting at the seams of enough is &ldquo;things to do.&rdquo; I will try to return the favor as best I can. Nobody I know is really suffering a surfeit of free time, and it would be rude to inundate them with my own recommendations while politely declining theirs. Know that if you ask, I have them in ready supply, but you will need to ask. This is as much for your own benefit as it is mine.</p>
<p>Something I failed to do last year was define success.</p>
<p>At the end of the Year of Enough, I think success would look like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Every room in the house is clean, organized, and there are no unsorted &ldquo;piles&rdquo; of things in need of a place to live.</li>
<li>There is enough time in the day to do work I enjoy doing, to care for my meat chariot, and to pursue an interest or hobby.</li>
<li>Nothing I consider important is languishing. This might need its own blog post to properly develop, but the idea is that I should not be able to look around and find some interest or hobby that I haven&rsquo;t engaged with, that I shouldn&rsquo;t feel like I&rsquo;m not taking care of myself or others.</li>
</ul>
<p>There will never be enough time to do everything, but there should be enough time to do the important things.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The tactical result of an engagement forms the base for new strategic decisions because victory or defeat in a battle changes the situation to such a degree that no human acumen is able to see beyond the first battle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Or,</p>
<p>&ldquo;No battle plan ever survives contact with the enemy.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>-Helmuth von Moltke the Elder</p>
<p>Nearing the end of the year, I&rsquo;m starting to think about next year&rsquo;s theme. But before I get into that, I think it&rsquo;s worth reviewing how <a href="https://thewizardly.com/2023/12/31/its-the-last.html">this year&rsquo;s theme</a> went.</p>
<p>TL;DR &ndash; poorly.</p>
<p>Looking back on how I defined my theme for the year, I think the idea was solid, but I lacked clarity on what exactly I meant to do differently. One big mistake is that, outside of the start of the year, I mostly never thought about it again. It didn&rsquo;t serve as a &ldquo;north star&rdquo; like so many yearly themes do. Whereas the Year of Time (2023,) kept popping up everywhere I looked, the Year of Scales of Arpeggios mostly just happened.</p>
<p>In the blog post linked above, I set out three specific plans I intended to engage in. If you haven&rsquo;t clicked through, they were:</p>
<ul>
<li>Wake up before work, use that time productively.</li>
<li>Build a system for meal planning.</li>
<li>Learn to play disc golf.</li>
</ul>
<p>And dear reader, I did approximately none of them.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not quite entirely fair, I actually did get really good at waking up earlier. But I don&rsquo;t really use the time productively. I think the end result is that I&rsquo;m more &ldquo;awake&rdquo; when work starts, and that has some positive benefits, but never not once did I ever get my treadmill time in before the day started. Planning the day continues to be an elusive challenge. Executing the plan even more so.</p>
<p>It feels hardly worth even mentioning the other two, beyond saying that I didn&rsquo;t even start to try. I forgot I meant to. The year got away from me and now here we are, on the precipice of December, and I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m planning to start any of that in the remaining four weeks.</p>
<p>We can&rsquo;t win them all, and I didn&rsquo;t win this one. On to bigger and better things!</p>

			 <p>You might surmise that this is a political post. And it sort of is, but also it isn&rsquo;t. Because winter has always been coming. And most likely, winter will always be coming. Winter might be Trump, it might be climate change, it might be an asteroid that strikes the Pacific ocean and obliterates all life as we know it. We don&rsquo;t know when winter will come, nor what form it will take, but winter is coming.</p>
<p>Some people will read that and assume that I am being defeatist. That clearly, we must all give up in the face of insurmountable odds. And no, read what I said because it doesn&rsquo;t include anything about giving up. Despite it all, I&rsquo;m not a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nihilism">nihilist</a>.</p>
<p>That winter is coming is an indisputable fact of our universe, and the answer to winter is to chop wood, preserve food, <a href="https://usdictionary.com/idioms/hunker-down/">hunker down</a>, and tell stories. Prepare for winter; to be able to weather it, because you do not control which way the wind will blow. You never did, and you never will. Winter can and will show up on its own schedule, in its own way, and there is nothing to be done about it except to prepare.</p>
<p>Our ancestors built communities by huddling together around the fire, and though the mode may have changed the method remains. Many hands make light work, and there remains much work to be done. There always will, because the universe does not owe us peace. The universe does not owe us anything. Winter is coming, and the only chance we have to stand against it is together.</p>
<p>With any luck, and no small amount of fortune, we will get to plant trees under whose shade we will never sit. It is not for us to rest, because winter is coming. But we might hope that others may some day wonder at what winter ever was.</p>

<p>Wargaming as a hobby is incredibly cloistered, a series of rituals performed by robed adherents, and the systems broadly share so many concepts that you often draft on one to learn another. This means that onboarding someone into our mystery is often an afterthought - the process starts by reading thirty some-odd pages of scripture, but the real questions you&rsquo;ll grapple with are the same as the fresh acolyte of any religion. They will all be within interactions the &ldquo;rules&rdquo; only suggest. It&rsquo;s not that the map isn&rsquo;t the territory - it&rsquo;s that the map generally describes a world which cannot possibly exist, and the work is in harmonizing that with the real world. This is a form of labor I delight in! But there might be hard limits on how many people want to collaboratively embroider a secular religion in their leisure time.</p>

		<a href="https://thewizardly.com/2024/10/25/on-generative-ai/" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2024-10-25 13:25:22 -0500">Oct 25, 2024</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I would describe myself as &ldquo;cautiously optimistic&rdquo; about generative AI. LLMs are clearly capable of doing some useful things. Anyone who tries to argue otherwise at this point probably sounds a lot like they&rsquo;re trying to argue the sky isn&rsquo;t blue or the moon isn&rsquo;t cheese.</p>
<p>For a little background, I first heard about GPT-2 back when it came out, a couple of years before ChatGPT hit the world stage, and some of the smartest nerds I know were marveling at the fact that you could get it to play chess competently. This was a surprising result, because LLMs use statistical techniques against words to predict outputs given an input. It shouldn&rsquo;t know what &ldquo;chess&rdquo; is, and it shouldn&rsquo;t be competent at the game.</p>
<p>Early ChatGPT didn&rsquo;t really impress me that much, and it routinely got stuff wrong. My best example of this would violate confidentiality, so consider that I&rsquo;m not necessarily trying to convince you that old ChatGPT sucked. I think that should be obvious. Mostly I&rsquo;m mentioning it to explain why I didn&rsquo;t even bother to start trying to use it or its competitors until much later.</p>
<p>Once Google announced Bard, I joined that bandwagon and made a few slight attempts to get it to do something useful. It mostly couldn&rsquo;t, which also shouldn&rsquo;t be surprising. An example of this was asking it to plan a Hawaiian vacation for me. I figured planning a vacation was the kind of thing that GenAI could probably handle, there should be lots of examples of vacations that people enjoyed. It really, really wanted me to go see the Pearl Harbor memorial. (I did not.)</p>
<p>Okay so that&rsquo;s all fine and good. Jump to today. I use ChatGPT at work, and Claude at home, and for my use cases, I think Claude is a lot better, but I wanted to talk a little bit about what I&rsquo;m actually using them for. What do I think they&rsquo;re good at?</p>
<p>ChatGPT has proven itself quite adept at taking my stream of consciousness and making something other people could understand from it. If I start typing out the details of an email I would like to send, the important points, the audience, the tone, it will generate an email that&rsquo;s perfectly cromulent. Same with a Slack message. But also same with a Jira ticket. If I know basically what needs to happen and the order it needs to happen in, then Jira saves me the trouble of spending time formatting it into a proper set of acceptance criteria.</p>
<p>Claude, with its Artifacts feature, has helped me develop and then fill out templates for data that I want to live inside my knowledge management system. I asked Claude for a template for a System of Systems document, and together we worked to refine it to have the detail level I wanted. Then I tossed it my list of systems, and it did a decent job of a first pass to fill it out.</p>
<p>The recurring theme is that I&rsquo;ve found GenAI saves me from <em>typing</em> but not from <em>thinking</em>. Best case scenario it will prompt me with some questions that I might not have considered, but the important connection-making and organizational work is still happening in my brain. Given that, even as an unstructured stream of consciousness, the LLM can then enforce an order and produce an output that might be useful for someone else trying to understand what I thought. I don&rsquo;t really expect this to change, and once the hype cycle properly dies down I think we&rsquo;ll discover it&rsquo;s roughly the limit of what an LLM can do. It&rsquo;ll get better at doing it, but it can&rsquo;t really have an &ldquo;original&rdquo; thought.</p>
<p>My question is how much money would you pay for the functionality I&rsquo;ve just described? Right now both ChatGPT and Claude have generous free tiers, but that&rsquo;s because their investors are expecting them to eat the world at some point, and, once eaten, for GenAI to have become so essential that people won&rsquo;t be able to remember how not to use it. They&rsquo;re building their captive audience today, and eventually that bill is going to come due.</p>
<p>I suspect the true cost of this service is a lot more than I&rsquo;d be willing to pay to avoid typing an email, but time will tell. Maybe we&rsquo;ll find a way to make &ldquo;good enough&rdquo; LLMs operate affordably. We&rsquo;re still in the &ldquo;a computer takes up an entire room and only universities have them&rdquo; phase of this technology, and right now I have five different computers on my desk all of which are more capable than a mainframe was in 1982.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m also concerned about the environmental impact, in the sense that we burn a truly fantastic amount of electricity to provide this service. But I think that&rsquo;s more general than LLMs. We spend a truly fantastic amount of electricity to do lots of things, and are generally incapable as a society of building real solutions to that problem.</p>
<p>Finally, I&rsquo;m concerned that OpenAI, Anthropic, and every other GenAI company out there had to basically steal all of the world&rsquo;s knowledge to build this thing. I mention this, because I think it&rsquo;s worth mentioning. Copyright infringement is apparently okay when Microsoft does it, but if the consumer pirates a copy of Windows now suddenly they care? I am not compelled by arguments about how hard it would be to solve this problem, nor how much it would cost. If we wanted to, we would. But I definitely think it&rsquo;s fair to consider this in your rubric for how seriously to respect the rights of corporations in turn.</p>
<p>For now I continue to stand by my policy of no GenAI content on this blog. It would defeat entirely the purpose. I&rsquo;m not trying to impress anyone. I&rsquo;m barely even trying to convince anyone. These are my thoughts, filtered through my own artistic sense of the right words to use to convey them. 90% of the value is that I took the time to express them, and 10% is whatever value other people might derive from consuming them. But it would be a tactical error to continue to avoid GenAI indefinitely. If you&rsquo;re not engaging with it currently I&rsquo;d strongly recommend thinking about where it might be able to help you; the answer is almost certainly not &ldquo;nowhere.&rdquo;</p>

			 <p>I have owned several iPads, and the role of the iPad in my life has changed over the years. With today&rsquo;s announcement of the new iPad mini, I think it&rsquo;s time to reevaluate which iPad(s) I need, and potentially start the trade-in process.</p>
<p><strong>Question #1</strong>: What do I actually use my iPad for today?</p>
<p>I have an iPad mini. I bought it around the time my kindle kicked the bucket, and my intention was to use it mainly as a reading device. In my mind I thought it&rsquo;d take it with me on appointments, but in practice I don&rsquo;t have many of those. It has come with me on every flight since I&rsquo;ve owned it, and it does a lot of heavy lifting as the main thing I do to keep myself busy while traveling. In that context, I mostly read blog posts through <a href="https://readwise.io/read">Readwise Reader</a>.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot to like about Reader, even though it&rsquo;s a beta product, but their offline reading experience falls a bit short: images aren&rsquo;t cached. That might not matter to some people, but ends up being pretty important in the kinds of blog posts I have a tendency to save for later reading.</p>
<p>Because it was intended to be a reading device, I got the 64GB version, which is not enough space to store movies or TV shows for offline watching. Sometimes, especially in hotel rooms, that&rsquo;d be a nice feature to have. I don&rsquo;t subscribe to any streaming services, so I need the files to be available on my iPad if I want to watch them.</p>
<p>Finally, it&rsquo;s a small use case, but the Citadel Colour app is only available on mobile, so despite the fact that I have an iMac on my painting desk, I need an iPad or similar for looking up paint recipes.</p>
<p><strong>Question #2</strong>: What do I think I might use my iPad for in the future?</p>
<p>Last weekend I purchased a <a href="https://us.kobobooks.com/products/kobo-sage">Kobo Sage</a> for eBooks. I really liked my Kindle, but I no longer shop with Amazon and do not intend to buy a new one. The iPad, it turns out, provides too many distractions and so I rarely read books on it. The Kobo probably won&rsquo;t arrive for at least another week, but once it does, I intend for it to live in my (not quite yet built) reading nook. It may not come on flights, I haven&rsquo;t decided.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s worth noting that the Kobo solves for a use case I intended the iPad to solve, but for which the iPad ended up being poorly suited: books. There&rsquo;s nothing wrong with the device, this is entirely a limitation of my attention. Given all the things an iPad can do, I get easily distracted and end up not reading long-form books. I think having a dedicated device that serves this role and has no distractions is key to getting myself to read more. It worked, in fits and spurts, with the Kindle. So the Kobo will do that now.</p>
<p>However, the Kobo doesn&rsquo;t solve for everything. It doesn&rsquo;t solve for &ldquo;read it later&rdquo; and it doesn&rsquo;t solve for graphics-heavy formatted PDFs, such as TTRPGs I back on Kickstarter.</p>
<p>Again, I&rsquo;m thinking out loud here so bear with me.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m starting to develop the following rubric:</p>
<ul>
<li>Text-focused books designed to be read for enjoyment, entertainment, or education will live on the Kobo.</li>
<li>Graphics-focused books will live on the iPad.</li>
</ul>
<p>To be clear, the iPad really does do these things equally well. It&rsquo;s more about the mental partitioning. I can&rsquo;t have one device that does both of these things because my squishy brain must be cajoled into doing things that I enjoy doing if the activation energy of doing them is greater than zero.</p>
<p><strong>Question #3</strong>: Which iPad?</p>
<p>The million dollar question. Or thousand dollar. Probably.</p>
<p>Really I think there&rsquo;s two contenders. The 13&quot; iPad Air and the new iPad Mini. For all intents and purposes they are functionally identical except for size.</p>
<p>I do like the size of the iPad Mini I have. It&rsquo;s easy to carry around. It moves around the house quite a lot. It&rsquo;s perfect for Reader, and acceptable for TV/Movies. I haven&rsquo;t tried referencing a TTRPG rulebook on it, and I will before I commit to a decision, but that&rsquo;s the one thing that I think the larger iPad is likely to excel at.</p>
<p>If, like me, you think &ldquo;well why not just keep the current iPad Mini&rdquo; then let me introduce one more variable. As I mentioned earlier, Readwise Reader doesn&rsquo;t work great in offline mode. So I&rsquo;m seriously considering getting the cellular-enabled model, which solves for lack of connectivity everywhere except airplanes, and which lets me solve another unrelated problem: kicking the tires on a new wireless provider in a way that doesn&rsquo;t require committing an existing device.</p>
<p>So now I&rsquo;m stuck in the worst possible place: compelling arguments between two options and no clear rubric to pick one or the other. The larger iPad seems like it&rsquo;d be better at looking at PDFs, the smaller iPad seems like it&rsquo;d be better for read-it-later blog articles. The smaller iPad is great for travel, and travel is the main thing I use my iPad for. The price difference between the two options doesn&rsquo;t really matter, but it&rsquo;s too expensive to get both and call it good.</p>
<p>What to do?</p>

			 <p><em>From the journals of St. Rev. Dr. McPunch, Dweller, Vault 76</em></p>
<p>&ldquo;Reclamation day&rdquo; my entire ass. The vault has everything we need, and I&rsquo;ve spent most of my life in it! Everyone else was in a hurry to get out and see the world. I&rsquo;ll tell you what you&rsquo;ll see: a fat lot of nothing. How could there be anything to see? Twenty years isn&rsquo;t nearly enough time to clear the rads. But I&rsquo;m running out of food, and I&rsquo;m going to have to go out there eventually. Might as well be on my terms.</p>
<hr>
<p>Of course once you go outside, the door closes behind you. Nothing to it but to do it I guess.</p>
<hr>
<p>Couple of girls standing near the vault entrance. &ldquo;A real dweller, gosh!&rdquo; I&rsquo;m as shocked as they were. There&rsquo;s still people out here? Guess there&rsquo;s some sort of rumor going &lsquo;round about treasure, and some people think it&rsquo;s the vault. Hate to break it to you, nothing in there. I bet it shut down the instant the last dweller (that&rsquo;s me, hi,) left. But there&rsquo;s people, and not just people from the vault. That&rsquo;s got to be something, right?</p>
<hr>
<p>Found the remnants of a farm not far down the hill, and a group of people calling themselves the Responders. They traded some basic supplies for a little help. I don&rsquo;t mind playing a bit of gopher for some chems and clean water. The bad news? I guess there&rsquo;s a cult? That worships the Mothman?! I ran some supplies for the Responders up the hill to another group calling themselves the Brotherhood. Bunch of tightwads, but caps is caps.</p>
<hr>
<p>Never thought I&rsquo;d see it, but someone left a Power Armor frame down at the farm. Just hanging out, free for the grabbing. It&rsquo;s been stripped for parts, so nothing more than a frame and a bit of juice to keep it moving. I wonder if I can find the missing parts?</p>
<hr>
<p>There was a call for help out of the South, something about a robot? I&rsquo;ll tell you, it was the most people I&rsquo;ve seen in one place since Reclamation Day. Mostly vault dwellers like myself, several with fully-functional sets of Power Armor. And me with my Little Slugger covered in razor blades. Oh well. I&rsquo;m not really sure that I was much help, but there was definitely a robot. Wearing a sheep? It was confusing. But I got some more caps and chems for my trouble.</p>
<hr>
<p>Overseer left a trail to follow, which has taken me to a little town called Flatwoods. Looks like it used to be a base of some kind for the Responders. I guess I&rsquo;m formally a Volunteer now? At least that&rsquo;s what the computer&rsquo;s saying. There&rsquo;s basically nobody left to confirm it, just one other random lady and her dog. Doesn&rsquo;t seem like she knows much about it either. I did some tests, cooked a burger, and stole anything not nailed down to the floor. It looks like they called everyone back to a place called Morgantown&rsquo;s airport. I&rsquo;ll have to go check that out at some point.</p>

			 <p>I might be the only person you know who doesn&rsquo;t shop on Amazon.</p>
<p>That’s not to say I never did. I had prime, many years ago. I even had a couple of those <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Dash">little IoT buttons</a> that could automatically order products inside a cabinet cupboard. I think I used one to order breath mints once.</p>
<p>Of all the things they have done and still do, there’s only one consumer level service from Amazon that I miss: my kindle.</p>
<p>Amazon got the experience of using the kindle extremely right. The page turn is fast and satisfying, the distractions are few, books load quickly. Except for the fact that Amazon makes it, it&rsquo;s the perfect device. So of course the baby must go out the window with the bathwater. It wouldn&rsquo;t be acceptable to say &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t shop on Amazon&hellip; Except for this one way in which I do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In case it&rsquo;s not abundantly clear, I take disproportionate amounts of psychic damage from small inconveniences. Maybe Steve Jobs and I <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2011/11/14/the-tweaker">would have gotten along</a>, because even the most trivial of ways in which a product can get something wrong will absolutely ruin it for me. Which is why I&rsquo;ve never quite found my stride using an iPad mini to replace my kindle. Oh it&rsquo;s a fine device. I&rsquo;d probably even recommend it. But I don&rsquo;t use it to read very many books, for about seventeen smallish reasons.</p>
<p>All of which is to say I think it might be time to reevaluate the eReader ecosystem.</p>
<p>By which I mean I already did that. Because there&rsquo;s really only a handful of players, the kindle is still dominant, and they all suck in one way or another.</p>
<p>But I think there&rsquo;s a path forward with <a href="https://us.kobobooks.com/collections/ereaders/products/kobo-libra-colour">Kobo</a>. It appears to have the best support for sideloaded books, and for a variety of reasons that&rsquo;s the way I need to be able to get my books on to a device. It also has the best support for getting my highlights back off through the stack of services I prefer using.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, they&rsquo;ve spent a lot of effort on their new pen ecosystem which looks cool but doesn&rsquo;t really seem to have a good export story. It doesn&rsquo;t help me to be able to &ldquo;draw&rdquo; on a digital book if that drawing is trapped forever on the kobo&rsquo;s screen. Sorry, Rakuten, this ain&rsquo;t that.</p>
<p>All other things being equal I&rsquo;d rather have a device that does one thing extremely well, and then carry as many such devices as needed. Almost nobody builds those devices anymore, there&rsquo;s no path to hockey stick unicorn trajectory golden parachute baked brie on rye simply being the best at solving a real problem these days. Also it needs AI. Sprinkle some AI on it. <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/bitches-love-smiley-faces">Bitches love AI</a>.</p>
<p>Which means, realistically, a device that&rsquo;s competent at the thing I care about, and then does a bunch of other stuff I don&rsquo;t. It&rsquo;s fine to have features I won&rsquo;t use, as long as they don&rsquo;t impact the experience. They usually do, because product managers literally can&rsquo;t help themselves. But we all fall far from the grace of dogs. I, too, have sinned. Etc.</p>
<p>Is this a long-winded way of saying that I&rsquo;m probably going to buy myself an eReader at some point this year? Probably. Will I still buy a new iPad mini if they announce them? Probably also yes. And carry both every time I catch a flight somewhere. But I think that&rsquo;s probably a worthy trade, in the hope that by specializing my use case for each they&rsquo;re marginally better at what I need them to do than the current mini is at half-doing both.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I spent most of last night talking with a dear friend about community and connection in the current age of the Internet.</p>
<p>We met, what feels like a hundred years ago, on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IRC">IRC</a>. I&rsquo;ve sat here, staring at that line, for several minutes, because I&rsquo;m not sure what I want to say about IRC. It was the perfect chat network for me, an environment where I thrived, and I miss it.</p>
<p>The astute may say something to the effect of &ldquo;but IRC&rsquo;s still there!&rdquo; Yeah. In the same way that Twitter&rsquo;s still there. Technically. If you have no respect for yourself. Technology has a way of clinging to a horrifying half-life long after the point where any reasonable person has left. IRC&rsquo;s still out there, but I think it&rsquo;s safe to say that it&rsquo;s inhabited almost exclusively by people who are pointedly refusing to accept that times change. Even though I, myself, think that the technologies that replaced it are generally worse, they&rsquo;re still where the people are, and the people are the part that matters.</p>
<p>Making new friends as an adult is hard, in part, because time is precious. I am very rarely in situations where connection happens automatically. Think of primary school. It&rsquo;s easy to make friends when you&rsquo;re young and in school because you&rsquo;re trapped in the same place with a group of people for long periods, going through the shared experience. Basically the only place that happens to an adult is work, and while it&rsquo;s possible to make friends at work it&rsquo;s not always the best place to do so. Depends an awful lot on where you work and what you do.</p>
<p>Social clubs once would have filled this niche, and probably still do for many. The elks, eagles, and most venerable moose are all different versions of an excuse for adults to hang out together. If you live somewhere with an active social club, my sense is that opportunity still exists. At least if TikTok is to be believed. TikTok would also like me to be very aware that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freemasonry">Freemasonry</a> exists. Thanks, TikTok. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jtU9BbReQk">ThikTok</a>.</p>
<p>One of the problems with a social club, assuming you could find one nearby, is that they frequently require you to be in a specific place at a specific time. I don&rsquo;t know about you, but all of my weeknight evenings are already spoken for, with a long list of things I wish I had time for already jostling to find a spare moment to infest my day. I would need to radically reorient my life to make an evening free to go spend it with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_Order_of_Odd_Fellows">IOOF</a>. Maybe that&rsquo;s still worth doing, at some point, but it&rsquo;s a hard sell!</p>
<p>The internet, at its best, enables a sort of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asynchronous_communication">asynchronicity</a> in communication. I can send you a message now, and you can reply to it later, and we can have a long, slow conversation that doesn&rsquo;t require either of us to be bound to a specific place or time. Email did this, before the spammers made it unsafe to share your email. Forums did it, back before Google trained us out of surfing the web. In theory this is great, because I can make it fit whatever my schedule happens to be, and does not require large contiguous blocks of time like a social club.</p>
<p>Being a part of the IndieWeb is a little subversive, in a way. It&rsquo;s staking a flag on the claim that the internet should be free. And a little bit weird. It&rsquo;s a thing that we all build together, separately, in our own way. And sometimes it&rsquo;s a little bit lonely. Being off the beaten path means fewer feet find their way to your digital garden. For better or worse. It&rsquo;s IRC, sort of, in the sense that we&rsquo;re all participating in the process of refusing to be part of the blessed path. It&rsquo;s also a community, if you want it to be. And there&rsquo;s connection, if you look for it. Certainly better than what&rsquo;s left of the festering corpse of Twitter.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not quite a social club, but it&rsquo;s a start.</p>

			 <p>A few months ago I looked back at my first 30 days of tracking 100% of my time. Now I have about a quarter&rsquo;s worth of data, and some patterns have emerged.</p>
<p>Looking at the data by project:</p>
<ul>
<li>Physiological Needs - 35%</li>
<li>Online Entertainment - 22%</li>
<li>Work - 19%</li>
<li>Hobbies - 12%</li>
<li>Other - 12%</li>
</ul>
<p>I think this is broadly in line with what I saw 30 days in. Physiological needs is mostly dominated by sleep, but includes some other &ldquo;maintenance of the human body&rdquo; type tasks that need to happen daily, and which slowly add up over time. The key takeaway for me is that, on average, the care and maintenance of my meat chariot is more than a third of my day. And that&rsquo;s not even particularly good care. That&rsquo;s darn near the bare minimum. It frustrates me how much time it takes to care for myself, and it&rsquo;s a number I wish that I could drive lower but know in my heart actually needs to be higher.</p>
<p>The other takeaway is that, at least in the quarter where I was measuring, I spent a <strong>lot</strong> more time on the various sub-categories of &ldquo;Online Entertainment&rdquo; (mostly video games,) than I would have otherwise estimated. I do enjoy video games, I just didn&rsquo;t think I spent that much time on them.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s possible to get a little bit deeper into where exactly that time went, when I look at the description I used to track it. In some cases the description always matches up with the category. Work is always work. In other cases, this is where it becomes possible to disentangle things.</p>
<ul>
<li>Sleep - 34%</li>
<li>Work - 19%</li>
<li>Computing - 7%</li>
<li>Travel - 7%</li>
<li>Fallout 76 - 6%</li>
<li>WoW - 4%</li>
<li>Cooking - 3%</li>
<li>Game - 3%</li>
<li>Good Eats - 3%</li>
<li>Errands - 2%</li>
</ul>
<p>I removed a couple of categories for personal reasons, so you may notice that doesn&rsquo;t quite add up to 100%. It is, however, the highlights.</p>
<p>Notice that sleep, at 34%, is only 1% shy of the entire physiological needs category. Travel only made it up to 7% because I booked an entire convention under the category. It seemed like the closest and most applicable way to track that time, but for convenience I tracked the whole event that way including time spent eating, sleeping, etc.</p>
<p>This leads me to two actionable conclusions.</p>
<ol>
<li>I probably spend a smidge more time gaming than I would ideally want to. As much as I enjoy this, it&rsquo;s the thing eating the most time from other hobbies.</li>
<li>All of my mental time budgets that assume I spend 1/3rd of my time &ldquo;sleeping&rdquo; fail to account for the rest of the time that it takes to maintain a human body.</li>
</ol>
<p>My next step, I think, is to retool the categories I&rsquo;m using to better reflect how I want to spend my day. &ldquo;Online entertainment&rdquo; lumps together too many things that I can only usefully split back out by the description on the time record.</p>
<p>Some of the categories I think it might be useful to track include:</p>
<ol>
<li>Multiplayer Games</li>
<li>Singleplayer Games</li>
<li>Content Creation</li>
<li>Content Consumption</li>
<li>Cooking (Hobby)</li>
<li>Cooking (Sustenance)</li>
</ol>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m getting a lot of actionable information out of tracking sleep, although it&rsquo;s useful for the habit of tracking everything else. Pretty sure there&rsquo;s a few other categories I never tracked that I&rsquo;m likely to trash entirely, but it&rsquo;s good to try the system recommended by others before you start making changes.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;d like to talk a bit about my favorite Massively Multiplayer Online PvP Game: <a href="https://www.ebay.com/">eBay</a></p>
<p>On the off chance you&rsquo;re not familiar, eBay is an auction platform. People post the trash they would like to sell, and other people post bids of how much they&rsquo;d be willing to pay for that trash.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s important to note, gentle reader, that it is always trash. Occasionally it is trash which happens to be quite valuable. It is nevertheless trash.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s okay, I&rsquo;m a purveyor of fine trash and trash accessories. This is my native habitat.</p>
<p>Within the eBay ecosystem it&rsquo;s somewhat customary to start an auction at $0.99, with the expectation that nothing actually sells for that much. It&rsquo;s either worthless and nobody bids, or it&rsquo;s quickly bid up to somewhere between what you could sell it for at a garage sale and what it&rsquo;s probably actually worth.</p>
<p>On the buyer side, eBay asks a relatively simple question. &ldquo;What is the most amount of dollarsmoney you would pay for this trash object?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I cannot stress this enough, dear reader. The answer to &ldquo;how many dollarydoos would you pay for this knicknack,&rdquo; there is only one acceptable answer. <em>Lies.</em></p>
<p>You see, under the hood eBay does something really quite clever. Let&rsquo;s say that a Trashthing is currently listed at a bid of $5. I perceive the Trashthing and decide that the most I would pay for it is $80. I would like to spend less than that, but I would be willing to go up to $80. If I were to tell this to eBay, magically eBay would manage bids for me. It would start with $6, which beats the person who had bid $5, and now the Trashthing is listed at $6. Assuming nobody else comes along, I will pay $6 and receive my Trashthing.</p>
<p>But let us say that someone else comes along and decides they would like to pay $20 for the Trashthing. They don&rsquo;t know that I&rsquo;ve already told eBay I&rsquo;m willing to pay $80, so they enter their $20 bid and like magic the price jumps to $21, and they&rsquo;re notified they&rsquo;ve lost. It is at this point, having already told eBay that they were willing to spend $20 and no more, that they walk away content in the knowledge that someone else was willing to pay more for the Trashthing than they were.</p>
<p><strong>Except no they don&rsquo;t.</strong> Do you know what they do? They extend their foul touchers to their mouse and their keyboard and they bid <em>again</em>. <em><strong>Again</strong></em>, dear reader. They put in a new maximum price of $30 or, if they are feeling particularly nasty, $35. And they lose again, because that&rsquo;s still less than my $80.</p>
<p>$45? No. Fine. They walk away, dejected. Except if they had just said $45 from the start, they could have avoided the hassle. The outcome for everyone is identical. They don&rsquo;t get the Trashthing because I&rsquo;m willing to pay more, I still pay $46, slightly more than the next closest bidder, and the seller receives the local maximum price for their Trashthing.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something deeply human about this process, because it happens every time. We renegotiate &ldquo;the most we&rsquo;d be willing to pay&rdquo; based on the amount other people have said they&rsquo;re willing to pay.</p>
<p>This is <em>asymmetric information warfare</em> at its most visceral. You do not know how much I value the thing, but you will find out repeatedly I value it more than you. And if I value it so highly, well, shouldn&rsquo;t you? And why shouldn&rsquo;t you have the Trashthing? It would look so very prim next to your collection of Whozits and Whatsits Galore. Thingamabobs? You&rsquo;ve got twenty. But who cares, no big deal. You want more.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s when things get meta. You know that I know this, but do I know that you know this? So what if, instead of the most I&rsquo;d be willing to pay, I put half? Then I can find out where the set point is. Maybe I&rsquo;m now the winner, maybe I&rsquo;m not. In either case I have new information. And if you come along and nickel-and-dime me out of the winning position, I have no incentive to fight you. All I&rsquo;ll do is drive the price up early. I have the signal I needed. At which point the winning strategy is always, always, to wait until as close to auction close as practical to swoop in with my true highest bid, in the hopes that you will be too busy in the real world to notice, and will have done something very similar, resulting in a &ldquo;maximum bid&rdquo; below your true bid.</p>
<p>Then, in approximately six hours, I discover if I&rsquo;ve won yet another MiniDisc player.</p>

			 <p>The way I make sense of the world is to talk about it, at length, with anyone who&rsquo;ll listen. Which frequently means the people closest to me are stuck listening to me as I work out any complicated long-poll decision making process.</p>
<p>A couple weeks ago I had an idea. The problem with a new idea is that if I do too much due diligence, I&rsquo;ll lose enthusiasm for it. Sometimes, I think, it&rsquo;s important to just carry forward and see what happens. On the flip side, sometimes I end up doing a bunch of work only to find out that the idea won&rsquo;t work out, for reasons that would have been obvious from the start if I had done some investigation.</p>
<p>This new idea lives somewhere in the uncomfortable middle. The reason I wanted to do it, it turns out, is no longer valid. But the idea itself has taken root in my mind with a life of its own.</p>
<p>You might notice I&rsquo;m being cagey. What is the idea? I can&rsquo;t say, because as soon as I explain what the idea was I&rsquo;ll lose enthusiasm for it. Being able to tell people about the thing I want to build removes all of the urgency around building it so that I can show them. So, I&rsquo;m sorry if it makes this post a bit harder or more frustrating to read.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ve got this idea to build a thing, and the reasons I originally wanted to build it are kaput. But maybe I should still build it anyway? That&rsquo;s the process I&rsquo;m currently working through (by which I mean my friends and family are suffering through.) Fortunately, I think I can distill it down into one big pro and one big con.</p>
<p><strong>PRO</strong> - I think this thing could be the chewy nougaty center around which an interesting community develops. The thing itself may not be viable for any of its original intended purposes, but I love building communities.</p>
<p><strong>CON</strong> - This will, like everything, suffer the opportunity cost of all the other things I&rsquo;m not doing instead. Of which there are many, because I have too many hobbies.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a core risk / reward decision to be made here. I could choose to spend that time doing many other things, some of which would be a lot more materially productive. But I will note, and it has been noted to me, that I have never been as visibly &ldquo;excited&rdquo; to be working on a project in the entire time my partner has known me. There&rsquo;s a certain magic about this kind of thing, and anything that brings the magic and vibrancy this idea has brought probably ought not to be ignored.</p>
<p>So, sorry for the vagueness. With luck, someday, I&rsquo;ll be able to talk more concretely about it. Either because it exists, or because I have decided it never will.</p>

			 <p>Establishing a baseline for reviewing things can be difficult.</p>
<p>Culturally, it seems like most Americans operate on a rating system that reflects the way that American schools grade. Start with a perfect score, then subtract points for failure.</p>
<p>No complaints about that book you got on Amazon? Five stars. Nothing wrong with your meal at the local Taco Palace? Five stars.</p>
<p>Noticed the bathroom wasn&rsquo;t as clean as you&rsquo;d expect at the Shop-o-Rama? Deduct one, maybe two. Now it&rsquo;s a three star experience.</p>
<p>This inflates scores up towards &ldquo;perfect.&rdquo; Anything that essentially passes the bar without complaints is as good as it can get. There&rsquo;s no room to differentiate the top end.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m strongly of the opinion that average experiences deserve an average rating. If you read a book and it was basically fine, no real complaints, but nothing stands out as exceptional? That should get a 50%. On the rare occasions that I see people doing this, it results in a lot of&hellip; Well. Let&rsquo;s call it &ldquo;feedback.&rdquo; So many people are accustomed to a perfect score being baseline from which complaints are subtracted that giving something that&rsquo;s essentially okay a 50% is likely to result in outrage from people that would agree with you that it&rsquo;s basically fine. The problem isn&rsquo;t that they think it&rsquo;s better than you do, it&rsquo;s that they think that mediocrity deserves a 90%+ score.</p>
<p>Again, it seems to me this is primarily an American thing.</p>
<p>Maybe it&rsquo;s because I see absolutely no value in maintaining the status quo where it doesn&rsquo;t make any sense to me, I&rsquo;ve never used this style of rating. Usually that means I need to publish a rubric.</p>
<p>For example, here&rsquo;s my rubric for recipes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>1 star: not good as-is, could be redeemed. Research and try again.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>2 star: one person liked this, but not both.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>3 star: we both liked this and would like to have it again.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>4 star: very good, should make once per month.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>5 star: the very best, should make every week.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Three stars is a perfectly fine recipe that we both liked. There&rsquo;s literally nothing wrong with it.</p>
<h2 id="okay-but-so-why">Okay, but, so&hellip; Why?</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;m in the process of setting up <a href="https://rpggeek.com/">RPGGeek</a> as the place to track my project of reviewing all these RPG books. They inherited a 10-star rating system from BoardGameGeek. I think it&rsquo;s awful, that&rsquo;s far too many stars, but the communities on that site have done a surprisingly good job of fighting back against rating inflation. The absolutely highest-rated board game has achieved an average rating of 8.60 with almost 50k votes.</p>
<p>But still, I disagree a bit with their published rubric. It&rsquo;s better than most, but I think still trends towards assuming that something basically okay should have a score of 6.</p>
<p>For RPG items, they publish this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>10 - Outstanding. Rules and concepts well presented and a near perfect fit to your play style. Excellent writing. Excellent Editing. Highly consistent throughout. You would highly recommend this book/product.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>9 - Excellent. Same as 10 but lacking in one or more of the elements (writing style, editing, consistency).</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>8 - Very Good. Rules and concepts are a good fit to your play style with some reservations. Solid writing. Solid Editing. Highly consistent throughout.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>7 - Good. Same as 8 but lacking in one of the elements (writing style, editing, consistency).</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>6 - Above Average. Rules and concepts are a reasonable fit to your play style but there are significant sections which you would change or not use in actual play. Solid writing. Solid Editing. Highly consistent throughout.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>5 - Average. Same as 6 but lacking in one of the elements (writing style, editing, consistency).</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>4 - Below Average. Rules and concepts are not a great fit to your play style and there are significant sections which you would change or not use in actual play. You would cherry pick a few ideas from such a book and discard the rest. Solid writing. Solid Editing. Highly consistent throughout.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>3 - Well Below Average. Same as 4 but lacking in one of the elements (writing style, editing, consistency).</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>2 - Poor. Rules and concepts are not likely to mesh at all with your play style and there are precious few things you can cull from this book to use in your actual play. Solid writing. Solid Editing. Highly consistent throughout.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>1 - Horrible. Same as 2 but lacking in one of the elements (writing style, editing, consistency).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s more thought than I see most sites giving the problem, but I want to propose an alternative.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>5 - Average. You would play this game. There is nothing particularly good nor bad about it. It&rsquo;s fine.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Okay, what moves us up the scale from a 5? I can think of three areas of analysis: mythos, production, mechanics.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Mythos</strong> - How interesting is the game&rsquo;s world? How evocative is the writing? Am I excited about the stories it wants to tell?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Production</strong> - How well-produced is the book? Art, writing, graphic design. How do the materials feel? Is this an object of beauty?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Mechanics</strong> - How playable is the game? Does it provide systems that are fun to engage with? How portable are those systems?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So let&rsquo;s pin a perfect 10 in our scale.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>10 - Outstanding. The world is vibrant and interesting, the stories are evocative. The item is finely produced and would be worthy of display. It is an art object in and of itself. The mechanics are interesting, clearly presented, and weave together to support the stories of the mythos.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And with that, I think we can pin a 1.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>1 - Horrible. This item has no redeeming qualities. The stories are not interesting, the world lacks color and flavor. The item itself is utilitarian and otherwise poorly produced. You would not want people to see it on your bookshelf. The mechanics offer nothing new or interesting. Best case scenario it&rsquo;s a retread of something other games have done better.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This scale lends itself really well to a four star system, where a book with none of these things would be a 1, and if it had all three it&rsquo;d be a perfect four. But I don&rsquo;t get to set the system on RPGGeek. One option is to map my system on to theirs. My four-star would be their 10-star, and then down by 3 for each intermediary. 10, 7, 4, and jump to 1 in the worst case. This has benefits and weaknesses. The best argument against it is that it loses granularity. What if there&rsquo;s one really good system, but the rest is trash? What if the cover is truly beautiful, but the pages inside phoned it in?</p>
<p>I can smooth out my system by taking my three axis ratings and giving each a half-step version that differentiates between &ldquo;they did this one thing really well&rdquo; and &ldquo;the whole system knocks it out of the park.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 id="so-then-i-created-a-spreadsheet">So then I created a spreadsheet&hellip;</h2>
<p>It turns out there&rsquo;s an &ldquo;easy&rdquo; solution to this problem. If by easy you mean &ldquo;Contrariwise is a crazy person who is totally unreasonable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Say it with me. (Or don&rsquo;t.) &ldquo;Weighted averages.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Imagine my three categories above: mythos, production, and mechanics. I can grade each of those on a scale from 1-5 where:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>5 - It knocked it out of the park in this category, the whole item is a delight throughout.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>4 - The item mostly succeeded, with a small number of critiques.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>3 - It&rsquo;s fine.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>2 - There&rsquo;s one or two redeemable qualities or systems, but mostly this ain&rsquo;t it chief.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>1 - Nope. No thanks.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If I rate each category on that scale, 1-5, then I can calculate the average of all of those rankings and arrive at a percentage. 5/5 in all three gets you a ten. 3/5 in all three gets you a five. (Really I&rsquo;d need 2.5 to do that, but it can be fudged in the formula.) 1/5 in all three&hellip; You get the picture.</p>
<p>So I think that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m going to plan to do. For now. I might revisit this after I&rsquo;ve tried it a few times. I might be missing things that end up being important. But it&rsquo;s a starting point, and I&rsquo;ve explained my reasoning so that if anyone ever wonders why I gave THAT BELOVED CLASSIC a &ldquo;5&rdquo; there&rsquo;s some chance of defending why. I mean. There&rsquo;s no accounting for taste.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I&rsquo;m not &ldquo;traditionally&rdquo; goal motivated. What do I mean by that? I mean if I tried to set a goal for a year from now that looked something like this: &ldquo;in one year I want to have written a book,&rdquo; that would not, on its own, result in any of the behaviors that lead to a book being written.</p>
<p>At the end of the year there would be no book, and also I would not feel bad. I do not experience any intrinsic desire to accomplish those kinds of goals, whether they&rsquo;re set by me or for me, and I do not feel any sense of loss, guilt, or shame for it.</p>
<p>So what does motivate me? Checking boxes on a todo list. Concrete accomplishment. A list of tasks to do, and the doing of them. It scratches something primal in my brain.</p>
<p>Put me in a video game where I can do anything I want but which provides no structure or list of tasks, and I&rsquo;ll be bored in less than fifteen minutes. (Sorry Morrowind and Oblivion, this is why we never got along.) But, ah, Skyrim! The first Elder Scrolls game to reliably produce a quest log that would direct me towards the interesting places? I sank easily a hundred hours into Skyrim.</p>
<p>So why mention it? I have a &ldquo;problem&rdquo; I&rsquo;m trying to &ldquo;solve&rdquo; and I think without this context it wouldn&rsquo;t make any sense at all why I see it as a problem, or why I feel like the solution needs to work in certain ways.</p>
<p>I have a truly fantastic collection of old <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tabletop_role-playing_game">TTRPG</a> source books. Originally I started collecting the first edition of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exalted">Exalted</a> because it lives rent-free in my head and I had, at one point, owned almost all of them but sold them off at a time where I desperately needed the money. I could talk at length about Exalted and I probably should at some point, but for various reasons it was an also-ran in the early-2000s RPG zeitgeist. You&rsquo;re forgiven if you&rsquo;ve never heard of it, most people haven&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>At one point a few years back I was trying to figure out what my &ldquo;next thing&rdquo; would be. I was successful and comfortable in a stagnant job with no growth opportunities and less challenge. At that time I thought one of the options could be to write my own TTRPG supplements, or to become a creator in that space. I thought maybe one opportunity would be to take all these old RPGs that mostly nobody remembers and try to resurface their best ideas.</p>
<p>Which brings me to my &ldquo;problem.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It would be really, really cool to read these books. I used to read TTRPG handbooks like they were novels when I was a teenager with a potato computer and dial-up internet and very little else to do but read. Now I&rsquo;m a busy adult with many important things to do and it&rsquo;s hard to find the time even for the things I know I love.</p>
<p>Given what I said at the top of the post, I think the likelihood that I actually do that improves a lot if I turn it into a list of tasks. A todo. Which, yes, I could probably do in <a href="https://www.omnigroup.com/omnifocus">Omnifocus</a> where I keep all of my other structural tasks. But I think &ldquo;read an entire 300 page book&rdquo; is probably too large of an ask for the kinds of things I usually keep in my routine todo list. I still use something that looks an awful lot like a version of <a href="https://gettingthingsdone.com/what-is-gtd/">Getting Things Done</a>. I strive to decompose big tasks into lots of little tasks so that it&rsquo;s easier to build momentum. I guess that&rsquo;d be possible with a book, but I think odds are I&rsquo;d spend more time managing that system than reading.</p>
<p>The answer to this that I&rsquo;ve imagined is to create the &ldquo;task&rdquo; structure for this project on my blog. To have a list of the books I need to read, broken down by system, always visible in a side bar. Books that haven&rsquo;t been read shouldn&rsquo;t be links, books that have been read should link to the blog post about them, where I would like to review their content, provide interesting context, and ideally surface whatever the best ideas of that book were.</p>
<p>And, if at all possible, I would like to avoid tedious hand maintenance of that list. Ideally I would be able to mark the posts somehow to link them to their record in the &ldquo;todo&rdquo; list, and then have the rest &ldquo;just work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If this sounds familiar, it&rsquo;s because I stole this idea from someone smarter than me. Like pretty much all of my best ideas. Sadly, I don&rsquo;t remember the name of the blog that did this, but I have a very clear picture in my mind of the format it used. List of links on the right. Every book for every TTRPG system they had, some linked to the review page and others just placeholders for the books yet to be reviewed. Probably they were doing the hard part by hand, because I think a sane person probably would.</p>
<p>Here are the options I&rsquo;ve currently thought of:</p>
<ol>
<li>Do it by hand.</li>
<li>Use a category.</li>
<li>Use a blogroll or similar plugin.</li>
<li>Use a datasource.</li>
<li>Create a second, related blog and put it there.</li>
</ol>
<p>I&rsquo;m unhappy with all of them. Why?</p>
<p><strong>Do it by hand:</strong> mainly, I&rsquo;ll forget. But also it&rsquo;s tedious. Also this is the year of our <a href="https://www.opry.com/">Opry</a> 2024, and it seems like something that software should be able to solve for me.</p>
<p><strong>Use a category:</strong> I think this would work well for publishing, but I lose the ability to have a list of unpublished posts. There&rsquo;s no good way to placeholder out what remains to be done.</p>
<p><strong>Use a blogroll:</strong> also seems to lose the ability to have a list of unpublished posts. Most of the plugins that are designed to do this really want to link to pages that exist.</p>
<p><strong>Use a datasource:</strong> actually seems to get the closest to what I think I&rsquo;d want, but requires me to hand-maintain a CSV or JSON file which is only marginally better than doing it as HTML directly in the template.</p>
<p><strong>Create a second blog:</strong> is, first and foremost, probably too much work. I&rsquo;ve got some experience with hugo, and two previous blogs that used it. There&rsquo;s a reason I now gladly pay for <a href="https://micro.blog/">micro.blog</a> instead. If I upgraded my plan, I could get a second micro.blog, but I think that then has all the same technical limitations AND now I&rsquo;ve bifurcated my online presence, defeating the purpose of trying to centralize on thewizardly.com in the first place.</p>
<p>So what do I do? At the moment, get stalled in analysis paralysis. But I think the play might be to do it by hand just to get started. If I limit the scope to just one TTRPG system (say, for example, Exalted,) then it&rsquo;s not actually that much to maintain. And once I get something up and visible and people can see what it is I&rsquo;m trying to do, I might be able to get someone who knows hugo/micro.blog better than I to suggest an even better way to achieve the result.</p>
<p>Plus, then I&rsquo;m actually doing the thing I want to do: reading and posting about these books. Not tinkering with a website that I would mostly prefer not to spend a lot of time tinkering with.</p>

			 <p>I really hated the Libre 2 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_glucose_monitor">continuous glucose monitor</a> (CGM.) A friend asked for some detail about why, which lead me down a long-winded story about the last five years of my health journey. About halfway through I thought &ldquo;this should be a blog post.&rdquo; So&hellip;</p>
<h2 id="everything">EVERYTHING</h2>
<p>Like my mother before me, I&rsquo;m a type 2 diabetic. I have tried just about every common intervention known to humankind. If it exists, and a doctor knows how to prescribe it, I&rsquo;ve probably taken it.</p>
<p>The most successful intervention I ever discovered was a combination of intermittent fasting, long fasts, and &ldquo;not really keto but sort of basically keto.&rdquo; I had an 8-hour daily eating window, occasional fasts that ranged all the way up to a week, and cutting the added sugar from just about everything but not going wholesale anti-carb.</p>
<p>I lost a truly fantastic amount of weight, was able to stop all my diabetes-related medications, and was generally the healthiest I&rsquo;ve been as an adult.</p>
<p>Despite hitting my lowest adult weight and the general level of my success, I was not at a weight my doctor considered ideal, and so he encouraged me to try semaglutide. I&rsquo;m not here to throw him under a bus, I think I have a pretty good doctor and he&rsquo;s been thoughtful and supportive all along. However, the promise of not having to work quite so hard to maintain this house of cards lead my entire non-pharmaceutical intervention strategy to crumble. And I mean, really crumble. Roman empire level of collapse.</p>
<p>Semaglutide didn&rsquo;t work for me. I mean it did, sort of technically, but not in the way one would want it to. I gained weight the entire time I was on it, but slower than I would have if I were left to my own devices. It had an effect, just not enough of one. Slowly, over the course of about a year, I regained all of the weight I lost. A new job during the time period and its associated stresses couldn&rsquo;t have helped.</p>
<h2 id="everywhere">EVERYWHERE</h2>
<p>Around December of this year we decided to try switching me from semaglutide to tirzepatide. I know lots of people who&rsquo;ve had truly amazing results on tirzepatide. My insurance company did what insurance companies do. They couldn&rsquo;t outright deny the prior-authorization. I fully qualify by their own standards. So they wrapped me up in so much paperwork trying to prove it that I decided fasting would be easier. Congratulations American healthcare system, you won.</p>
<p>Late March I decided to try a new fasting protocol that I had encountered called rolling fasts. Roughly 90 hours of fasting followed by a &ldquo;re-feed&rdquo; meal, followed by a new fast. This actually works great for me, for many reasons, and I think I probably won&rsquo;t go into all of them.</p>
<p>Shortly after I started I had some concerning symptoms that I will spare you the details of. It was enough to be concerned maybe the fasting wasn&rsquo;t safe. A couple months of fits and starts and diagnosis, we figured out it was unrelated and the problem passed. Ever since, I&rsquo;ve been happily maintaining a rolling fast without significant issue.</p>
<p>One of the things I like about rolling fasts is that I only eat once every four days, and that means I&rsquo;m rarely needing to figure out dinner at the last minute, which leads to making much better decisions about what to eat. And I&rsquo;m not saying perfectly healthy by any stretch of the imagination. But I am saying that I never run out to Taco Bell right after work because I forgot to buy groceries and accidentally falling mouth-first into a pile of spicy potato tacos.</p>
<p>I get a few days to really figure out what I&rsquo;m craving, and then whatever it is I get to go have it. Honestly? It&rsquo;s the healthiest emotional relationship with food I&rsquo;ve ever had.</p>
<h2 id="all-at-once">ALL AT ONCE</h2>
<p>Yesterday was my mid-year blood draw, and the results for my blood sugar aren&rsquo;t exactly grim, but they&rsquo;re not where I&rsquo;d want them to be. This has prompted some introspection. The main problem as I currently see it is that I don&rsquo;t have a good and reliable way to monitor my blood sugar during the fast and re-feed. And that&rsquo;s how we get to the topic of CGMs.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t mind a finger poke, but I think that method is highly susceptible to the games one can play with when they choose to check. Before a meal, fully fasted? Great! Perfect numbers! An hour after the only meal I&rsquo;ll have that week? High! But for how long? Who knows! My sense of blood sugar is that one of the things that really matters is how long it takes to come back down to a normal level after eating, and that&rsquo;s the kind of data one really only gets through a CGM. It matters a bit how high it spikes, but I&rsquo;m mostly not eating cake for dinner. What really matters is if I&rsquo;m spending the first two days of a four day fast just waiting for my blood sugar to come back down to a fasted state.</p>
<p>So I think I need to get back on a CGM, which I plan to talk to my doctor about at our next appointment. But I&rsquo;d like to try some of the other options that aren&rsquo;t the Libre 2, which as I mentioned, I hate. Loathe. Despise entirely. Some searching indicates the Libre 3 might not have any of the key problems that frustrated me, and the Dexcom Stelo is supposed to be coming sometime this summer.</p>
<p>The important thing from my perspective is to find a source of reliable data from which to act. I can&rsquo;t diagnose the machine if none of the sensors are working.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;ve spent the last several weeks using <a href="https://track.toggl.com">Toggl</a> to track 100% of my time, and the results have been interesting.</p>
<h3 id="reasoning">Reasoning</h3>
<p>On a flight to who knows where I read <a href="https://hbr.org/2023/12/use-strategic-thinking-to-create-the-life-you-want">Use Strategic Thinking to Create the Life You Want</a> and thought it had some interesting ideas to try, one of which was to rate certain areas of my life on a matrix of how important it was to me and how much time I spent on it.</p>
<p>There are some areas of my life that I don&rsquo;t think I spend enough time on, but my intuitive sense is that my time is mostly well-managed given that I only have 24 hours a day to work with. It seemed like an interesting experiment to try tracking 100% of my time for a while to see how well it lined up with my subjective experience.</p>
<h3 id="methodology">Methodology</h3>
<p>In the article they talk about &ldquo;Strategic Life Units&rdquo; (SLU) as the sixteen key areas where people spend their time. I set up a new Toggl workspace following that outline with six &ldquo;Strategic Life Areas&rdquo; (Relationships, Body Mind Spirit, Community, Profession, Interests, and Personal Care,) as clients assigned to the SLUs as projects.</p>
<p>My list of SLUs (plus, where applicable, examples):</p>
<ul>
<li>Mental Health</li>
<li>Physical Health - Exercise, but also going to the doctor.</li>
<li>Spiritual Health</li>
<li>Community - Local clubs, civic engagement. If elections were going on, I&rsquo;d put them here.</li>
<li>Society - Volunteering, activism.</li>
<li>Hobbies</li>
<li>Offline Entertainment - Going to a show or movie. Reading a book. Non-interactive entertainment. Touching grass.</li>
<li>Online Entertainment - Video games, streaming, general-purpose computing.</li>
<li>Daily Life - Errands, groceries.</li>
<li>Physiological Needs - Sleep, care of the meat chariot in which my brain resides.</li>
<li>Education</li>
<li>Finances</li>
<li>Work</li>
<li>Family</li>
<li>Friendship</li>
<li>Significant Other</li>
</ul>
<p>Where an activity could plausibly fit under two categories, I tried to pick the category where it fit &ldquo;best&rdquo; and then be consistent about it. For example, a meal which I ate alone would fall under &ldquo;Physiological Needs,&rdquo; but a meal eaten with friends would fall under &ldquo;Friendship.&rdquo;</p>
<h3 id="results">Results</h3>
<p>Aggregated over the last four weeks the majority of my time falls into one of four categories. The big winners, in order:</p>
<ul>
<li>40% Physiological Needs</li>
<li>27% Online Entertainment</li>
<li>17% Work</li>
<li>6% Hobbies</li>
</ul>
<p>The remaining 10% is split between a few different things, with Significant Other and Daily Life leading the pack at around 3.7% each.</p>
<p>So how do I feel about that?</p>
<p>Physiological Needs feels about right, since I used it to track (among other things) the time I was sleeping. And I sleep a lot. I always have. Being well rested is a super power and the older I get the more certain I am that time spent sleeping is time well spent.</p>
<p>But I was shocked to see how much time I spend on Online Entertainment. Now, granted, this might be a particularly unusual period. Two different four-day weekends fell during this period. Even still, looking at an average work day, it&rsquo;s the most likely thing to fill in the majority of the time between work and sleep.</p>
<p>Work seems basically fine, again considering the number of PTO days that fell in the sample period.</p>
<p>Hobbies is&hellip; Abysmal. Of that 6%, the majority was actually time spent cooking. Now I happen to think, for me, it&rsquo;s fair and accurate to count cooking time as hobby time. I absolutely love to do it. And the only reason there wasn&rsquo;t more of it is that I fast more days of the week than not. On days where I was planning to eat, cooking usually accounted for at least a few hours. It&rsquo;s time well spent. But all of my other hobbies (of which, honestly, there are too many,) are generally languishing.</p>
<h3 id="next-steps">Next Steps</h3>
<p>I would like to see Online Entertainment come down. The four biggest sources contributing to Online Entertainment during this time were:</p>
<ul>
<li>&ldquo;Game&rdquo; - Basically playing some game. This does make sense given the Steam Sale, and might be unusually high given my PTO.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Computing&rdquo; - My catch-all category for time spent &ldquo;farting around&rdquo; on a computer. This could be social chatting, it could be reading RSS.</li>
<li>&ldquo;WoW&rdquo; - Specifically playing World of Warcraft.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Good Eats&rdquo; - Rewatching the TV show Good Eats, which I enjoy especially mid-fast when all I want to do is plan my next meal.</li>
</ul>
<p>I enjoy gaming, and I think it could rightly be tracked as hobby instead, so I think I&rsquo;m going to monitor it for another few weeks and see if it stays as high as it has. Not yet concerned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Computing&rdquo; is, generally speaking, not time well spent. There&rsquo;s some important stuff that gets lumped in there mostly because I forget to update Toggl, but I think driving that down is a worthy goal.</p>
<p>World of Warcraft is, at this point, more of a social opportunity than a game. There was an event running during part of the sample period that I think lead to more than the usual amount of playing, so I do want to keep an eye on that, but also there&rsquo;s a new expansion due towards the end of the summer that would drive this back up. The important thing to me is to not spend &ldquo;idle time&rdquo; in WoW, and I almost never do that.</p>
<p>Good Eats and the watching of streaming in general is not awful, and I suspect less than what would be considered &ldquo;average,&rdquo; but I would prefer to spend at least some of that time working on hobbies instead. No concrete plans there, but something to keep in mind.</p>
<p>What do I want to see more of? Friendship, Significant Other, and Hobbies.</p>
<p>In an average month I see friends in the real world approximately once. I don&rsquo;t know many people who live near me, because I moved to the middle of nowhere during the pandemic. I do like living here, but I wish I had more social connections that didn&rsquo;t require a flight. I&rsquo;ve also slowly become awful at maintaining my digital friendships, and I likely need to do something about that.</p>
<p>My SO and I live together, and do a lot together, and I think that&rsquo;s mostly getting lumped into other categories out of convenience. It&rsquo;d be nice to be more intentional about that.</p>
<p>Entire swathes of my hobbies have been ignored for truly worrying amounts of time. I haven&rsquo;t run a TTRPG campaign in going on three years now, and the last time I worked on my Warhammer armies was probably March.</p>
<h3 id="summary">Summary</h3>
<p>Tracking 100% of my time for a few weeks was really eye-opening. I &ldquo;waste&rdquo; more time than I would have guessed, and it seems like I should be able to come up with some systems to help me be better about that. But there are also places where I&rsquo;m right on track, and if nothing else it&rsquo;s nice to know where those are.</p>

<p><em>Important Note #1</em> - This is a draft recipe. I made it somewhat improvisationally, so the amounts are in many cases a rough guess. Please don&rsquo;t consider this a bulletproof tested recipe.</p>
<p><em>Important Note #2</em> - I tend to think of most larger recipes as a series of smaller recipes that get assembled, so this is presented in that way.</p>
<p><em>Important Note #3</em> - I almost never add salt and pepper to taste to recipes as an instruction. Assume that you should taste things, decide if you think they&rsquo;re salty enough, and then add more if needed.</p>

<h2 id="final-assembly">Final Assembly</h2>
<p>I made these with two mini baguettes cut in half down the middle because I live in the middle of nowhere and that was the closest thing I could get to the traditional sandwich roll. I think in the future I&rsquo;ll make these on brioche buns just for practicality. The sandwiches wouldn&rsquo;t close.</p>

			 <p>In no particular order, an update on various interests and hobbies.</p>
<h3 id="clocks">Clocks</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://thewizardly.com/2023/11/04/freshly-repaired-cleaned.html">mantle clock</a> is running strong, but about five minutes fast per day. It uses a balance wheel, which is a particularly fragile and difficult-to-adjust mechanism, so I haven&rsquo;t taken it down and tried to fix that yet.</p>
<p>The grandfather clock is out for repairs <a href="https://theoldfashionway.com/">with a professional</a>. Again. He thinks he&rsquo;s found the source of the problem, and intends to publish a youtube video about it. I think it&rsquo;s probably a good (or bad) sign when someone has to post a video about a new and interesting way that a clock can break. (It was magnets.)</p>
<h3 id="minidisc">MiniDisc</h3>
<p>Since he was here to collect all the parts of the grandfather clock, I asked the clock guy (who also does radio repairs,) if he wanted to take a swing at <a href="https://www.minidisc.wiki/equipment/sony/portable/mz-e3">one of my MiniDisc players</a>. It was sold as non-functional with the description of &ldquo;makes a whooshing noise.&rdquo; I bought it because it came with what turned out to be a true goldmine of discs recorded &ldquo;by a Los Angeles DJ.&rdquo; The player was in beautiful physical condition, and it&rsquo;s now repaired and working after a swap of the digital to analog converter.</p>
<p>Oh, and I bought a copy of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_Moods">Pure Moods</a> on CD to convert over to MD, because it feels somehow cosmically right. Also the way this particular album looms in the psyche of people who were kids in the 90s. Young me would probably be ecstatic that we finally had a copy.</p>
<h3 id="ttrpgs">TTRPGs</h3>
<p>I think I&rsquo;ve lost one of my <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earthdawn">Earthdawn</a> books somewhere in the house. I&rsquo;ve done a thorough-enough search to think that maybe I never actually had it, but there&rsquo;s some anecdata to suggest that I did. Unrelated to that, I was able to find a copy of <a href="http://www.itcamefromthebookshelf.com/2022/01/earthdawn-1e-prelude-to-war.html">Prelude to War</a> at a local(-ish) used book store, leaving only four books missing from my 1e Earthdawn collection.</p>
<p>At the same time I also picked up <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Complete_Sha%27ir%27s_Handbook">The Complete Sha&rsquo;ir&rsquo;s Handbook</a>, which is wizard archetypes for the old D&amp;D setting of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Qadim">Al-Qadim</a>. It&rsquo;s in pristine condition and was a pretty penny in the bookstore&rsquo;s rare book room. I usually prefer to buy play copies, because Toys Are Meant to be Played With, but sometimes with these old TTRPG books it&rsquo;s either buy the perfect copy at collector&rsquo;s prices or accept I won&rsquo;t own it. Even play copies are rare. These old D&amp;D settings are interesting to me, and the books are often very &ldquo;of their time&rdquo; in an almost charmingly unaware way. Nobody who wrote this book had ever heard the word appropriation, and it usually shows.</p>
<p>The hardbound copy of <a href="https://possumcreekgames.com/pages/yazebas-bed-breakfast">Yazeba&rsquo;s Bed and Breakfast</a> finally arrived. It went directly on a shelf, because I don&rsquo;t currently have the capacity to do anything with it, but I remember being charmed by the concept and thinking it might be light enough to convince some local friends to pick up casually without having to resort to digital play. With all due apologies to people who can only ever get their gaming group together on Discord, it&rsquo;s not the same.</p>
<h3 id="world-of-warcraft">World of Warcraft</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.wowhead.com/guide/wow-remix-mists-of-pandaria-overview">WoW Remix: Mists of Pandaria</a> is probably the best and smartest thing Blizzard has done since Wrath of the Lich King. No I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m being hyperbolic. It&rsquo;s that good. I think part of why it&rsquo;s that good is that it&rsquo;s meant to be a limited duration event, which means that it can be fun in a way which is not also trying to prolong my subscription past its natural lifespan. It&rsquo;s not trying to sell me any DLC.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a reminder that somewhere in the shambling husk of Blizzard Activision is the beating heart of the company that made Warcraft 3 and Diablo 2. That, if they weren&rsquo;t in the throes of a dark insanity known as shareholder primacy, they might actually be capable of doing the one thing anyone actually wants them to do: making a good game.</p>
<p>I hope they keep this format and go on to do it for other expansions. I&rsquo;d be especially glad to see it of Shadowlands, the one expansion I never got around to playing.</p>

			 <p>I had the great fortune to spend the last week or so sailing along Alaska&rsquo;s inside passage on the NCL Jewel. Being the kind of person that I am, I gave myself a side-quest on day one: eat at and review each of the on-board dining options. I mostly succeeded, with two notable exceptions. It turns out a reservation at the Teppanyaki restaurant is incredibly difficult to score, and I simply ran out of time for the steakhouse.</p>
<h2 id="but-first-the-rubric">But First, the Rubric</h2>
<p>Taking inspiration from Michelin stars, I decided to categorize each dining option with the Contrariwise Boat Emoji System. Boatmoji if you will.</p>
<ul>
<li>0 (Zero) boats - Anything I wouldn&rsquo;t expressly recommend. Runs the gamut from terrible to basically fine. Might be perfectly cromulent, but doesn&rsquo;t stand out.</li>
<li>1 (One) boats 🛳️ - Worth a visit. If it requires a reservation, consider making one.</li>
<li>2 (Two) boats 🛳️🛳️ - Plan around it. Get at least one reservation, at any day or time you can, and schedule other things to accommodate.</li>
<li>3 (Three) boats 🛳️🛳️🛳️ - Vacation highlight. Take a cruise specifically to go to this restaurant.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-restaurants">The Restaurants</h2>
<h3 id="osheehans">O&rsquo;Sheehans</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Rating</strong>: 0 boats</li>
<li><strong>Style</strong>: Casual</li>
<li><strong>Cuisine</strong>: Bar food</li>
</ul>
<p>Generally speaking, O&rsquo;Sheehans had both the worst food and worst service of the trip. It&rsquo;s the kind of place you go to kill 1.5 hours waiting on the smallest plate of nachos you&rsquo;ve seen in your life. As everywhere on the boat, the staff were both patient and kind. I think the delays were frequently because the O&rsquo;Sheehans kitchen is also providing room service, and so no matter how busy (or not) the restaurant appeared to be, I suspect there were at least double as many tickets accounted for by room service requests.</p>
<p>The nominal benefit of O&rsquo;Sheehans is that it&rsquo;s open 24 hours, has no dress code, and no reservations. But I think I&rsquo;d recommend the buffet categorically over O&rsquo;Sheehans at any time when the buffet is open and operating.</p>
<p>Speaking of&hellip;</p>
<h3 id="garden-cafe-the-buffet">Garden Cafe (The Buffet)</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Rating</strong>: 0 boats</li>
<li><strong>Style</strong>: Buffet</li>
<li><strong>Cuisine</strong>: Rotating</li>
</ul>
<p>Buffet (noun): the opportunity to eat as much as you would like of food that would not be acceptable at any other time.</p>
<p>Jokes aside, I actually rather liked the buffet, and I think it&rsquo;s the &ldquo;set point&rdquo; for all other on-ship dining. O&rsquo;Sheehans falls slightly below, most other things are equal are slightly above. The buffet is fine. It never really excelled, but it was reliable. It always made for a quick breakfast or lunch, but I never made it for dinner generally preferring to work on my quest to eat at every other option. I think the buffet is never the wrong option, especially if you&rsquo;re in a hurry or don&rsquo;t want to wait to be seated.</p>
<h3 id="le-bistro">Le Bistro</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Rating</strong>: 🛳️ (1 Boat)</li>
<li><strong>Style</strong>: Fine Dining</li>
<li><strong>Cuisine</strong>: French</li>
</ul>
<p>Le Bistro is the one place on the ship that had a dress code, and despite a few ruffled feathers about whether or not my collared sweater qualified (it did,) I had a mostly pleasant experience. I think that other options on the boat win for atmosphere, but the food here never disappointed. I can strongly recommend both the escargot and the french onion soup. There are other restaurants on the ship that will claim to have french onion, but none of them will be as good as what Le Bistro serves.</p>
<p>What really stole the show for me was the dessert at Le Bistro, a strawberries and cream fraisier with pistachio topping. I would rank it as &ldquo;dangerously good&rdquo; and worth the price of admission alone.</p>
<h3 id="chin-chin">Chin Chin</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Rating</strong>: 🛳️ (1 Boat)</li>
<li><strong>Style</strong>: Casual</li>
<li><strong>Cuisine</strong>: Chinese</li>
</ul>
<p>We had to wait an hour to sit at Chin Chin, and I can see why. I ordered the kung pao chicken and I&rsquo;m somewhat at a loss for how to describe it. Spicy teriyaki chicken? Clearly non-traditional, none of the flavors that I expected, and yet somehow still incredible. Maybe they went with that name due to familiarity, maybe they just don&rsquo;t know how to make kung pao and lucked into something that works? I won&rsquo;t fault them for the non-traditional take, because it so clearly worked and was clearly at least inspired by kung pao with a spice that both built and lingered. A friend had many compliments about their chicken fried rice, and several people got calamari that was lightly fried but not chewy, the hallmark of well-prepared squid.</p>
<p>The highlight of my dinner at Chin Chin was actually a cross-order which deserves its own section&hellip;</p>
<h3 id="sushi-by-way-of-chin-chin">Sushi (by way of Chin Chin)</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Rating</strong>: 🛳️🛳️ (2 Boats)</li>
<li><strong>Style</strong>: Counter seating</li>
<li><strong>Cuisine</strong>: Sushi</li>
</ul>
<p>It&rsquo;s possible to book directly into the sushi restaurant, but it can also be ordered from Chin Chin, which is what I did in order to save time. I can&rsquo;t overstate how good it was; at $11 for two pieces of nigiri, it had better have been. But I want to be clear, the sushi on board the NCL Jewel is among the best I&rsquo;ve ever had.</p>
<h3 id="la-cucina">La Cucina</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Rating</strong>: 0 boats</li>
<li><strong>Style</strong>: Casual</li>
<li><strong>Cuisine</strong>: Italian</li>
</ul>
<p>The vibe, as they say, was immaculate. Better than Le Bistro&rsquo;s no doubt. But the food didn&rsquo;t live up to the same expectation. It was fine, maybe even two points north of acceptable. But hard to recommend. If you like Olive Garden, you&rsquo;ll like La Cucina. I think the gnocchi where my highlight, and probably the best gnocchi I had all week.</p>
<h3 id="azura--tsars-palace">Azura / Tsar&rsquo;s Palace</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Rating</strong>: 0 boats</li>
<li><strong>Style</strong>: Casual</li>
<li><strong>Cuisine</strong>: Rotating</li>
</ul>
<p>Azura and the Tsar&rsquo;s Palace are two sides of the same coin. Either or both could be referred to as &ldquo;main dining,&rdquo; with the only real difference between them being the ambiance and decor. I will note that we found the service in Tsar&rsquo;s Palace to be slightly more reliable. Nominally the more casual option, Azura, reminded me of just about every &ldquo;fast-casual&rdquo; restaurant I&rsquo;ve eaten at.</p>
<p>The food choices changed slightly throughout the week, but were generally the kind of thing you might find at Chili&rsquo;s or Applebees, and about the same quality overall. Tsar&rsquo;s palace offered the same menu, but with an interior designed to evoke old-style regal charm. For what it&rsquo;s worth, the palace also had bathrooms inside the restaurant, a rare luxury on the Jewel.</p>
<h3 id="moderno-churrascaria">Moderno Churrascaria</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Rating</strong>: 0 boats</li>
<li><strong>Style</strong>: Buffet</li>
<li><strong>Cuisine</strong>: Brazilian</li>
</ul>
<p>In what I&rsquo;m certain will be my most controversial opinion, Moderno was&hellip; Okay? I guess? I&rsquo;m not convinced it was better than Garden Cafe, except that I paid $70 for it. Like other Brazilian Steakhouses the gimmick is mostly that people walk around and carve fresh hunks of animal directly on to your plate. I&rsquo;m mostly of the opinion that those animal hunks were&hellip; Fine? I guess? Neither the quality nor flavor really stood out from among all the other animal hunks I had on the boat.</p>
<p>The salad bar portion of Moderno was marginally upscaled compared to Garden Cafe. They had manchego cheese, which I like, and the charcuterie was decent. It felt sort of like something I might have thrown together for some friends that I wanted to impress but like&hellip; Not too much? Basically what I&rsquo;m trying to say is that it was okay, but left to my own devices I might spend my dining credits elsewhere.</p>
<h2 id="overall-impressions">Overall Impressions</h2>
<p>Generally, I liked pretty much all of the food I had on the NCL Jewel. I don&rsquo;t think any of it was &ldquo;bad,&rdquo; although much of it was &ldquo;okay.&rdquo; That doesn&rsquo;t really surprise me, and I think there are other cruise lines that lean harder into the food as a draw. I appreciated that for the most part Norwegian doesn&rsquo;t require specific dress codes or assigned seating, something I&rsquo;ve heard other cruise lines still do. I&rsquo;d cruise the NCL Jewel again without hesitation.</p>

			 <p>Language is hard. Communication is harder. When someone receives a communication, they interpret it through their own understanding and world view and the message that&rsquo;s ultimately received may bear only a passing resemblance to the one that was intended. Ideally, we&rsquo;re all working to get better at communicating what we actually intend, since the burden is on the communicator to be understood, not the receiver to interpret.</p>
<p>With this in mind, I&rsquo;m writing this as something of a preemptive &ldquo;disambiguation&rdquo; of some terms I intend to use in future blog posts with two intentions in mind:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>I want to be clear with myself what these words mean and how I should use them, so that hopefully I do not make the mistake of using them in the wrong way such that other people are less likely to understand me.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I want to be clear with everyone else how I am intending to use these words, for the same reason as above.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>In the end my goal is to &ldquo;think in public&rdquo; about the world in a way that helps me understand it better. With any luck, that might also help some other people understand it better, or at least understand me better.</p>
<h2 id="defining-ground-truth">Defining &ldquo;Ground Truth&rdquo;</h2>
<p>When I use the term &ldquo;ground truth&rdquo; I am referring to to what other people might call &ldquo;objective reality.&rdquo; These are the things we, as a society, &ldquo;know.&rdquo; Usually through direct observation, measurement, and empirical evidence.</p>
<p>The earth is round. This is ground truth. Some people &ldquo;believe&rdquo; otherwise. Beliefs are derived from ground truth, but they do not influence ground truth. Our ability to understand ground truth is imperfect, and we may be wrong about some parts of it, but the preponderance of credible sources currently agree.</p>
<p>Often, but not always, it is possible for you to demonstrate ground truth through your own observation or empirical measurement. Eratosthenes of Cyrene <a href="https://www.wired.com/2012/06/june-19-240-b-c-the-earth-is-round-and-its-this-big/">demonstrated the earth was round in 240 B.C.</a> using shadows, an experiment you can run yourself with an afternoon&rsquo;s lazy drive in the car.</p>
<h2 id="defining-belief">Defining &ldquo;Belief&rdquo;</h2>
<p>When I use the term &ldquo;belief&rdquo; I am referring to the entire host of things which a person might hold to be either true or false, but which cannot be empirically proven. These are the things you might &ldquo;know&rdquo; which are not ground truth.</p>
<p>Beliefs are often based on our understanding of ground truth, but sometimes they&rsquo;re not. There are things people believe to their core that have no basis in our shared objective reality. Where people (myself included) get themselves into trouble is conflating the things we happen to believe with truth. I absolutely believe all of the things that I believe happen to be true. I also acknowledge the statistical likelihood of that is approximately zero.</p>
<p>The closer you can get your beliefs to ground truth, the more valuable your insights become. To yourself and to others. I only know of one way to do this, which is to take a cherished belief and really investigate it. Tear it down to its core and figure out why you believe it. Where did you learn the subset of things that made you believe that particular thing? Do they still hold up relative to the other things you know or believe? Beware of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_dissonance">cognitive dissonance</a>.</p>
<h2 id="defining-principles">Defining &ldquo;Principles&rdquo;</h2>
<p>When I say &ldquo;my principles&rdquo; what I really mean are the rules by which I live my life. They are not fundamental ground truth, although in many cases my intention is that they are reflective of it. They&rsquo;re decisions I&rsquo;ve made about what&rsquo;s important, turned into systems.</p>
<p>Principles are like an operating system. They&rsquo;re decisions made in advance about what&rsquo;s important, what matters, and how to respond to various stimuli.</p>
<p>Being vegetarian or vegan is a principle. It comes from a person&rsquo;s understanding of ground truth, their beliefs, and is ultimately codified in the pre-made decision about what they will or won&rsquo;t eat.</p>
<h2 id="other-terms">Other Terms</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;m avoiding defining a few things: ideas, values. Probably others. I think for purposes of the kinds of things I&rsquo;m intending to talk about what constitutes an <strong>idea</strong> won&rsquo;t matter, and <strong>values</strong> are just a specific subspecies of beliefs. There are some academic senses where the distinction matters, but I don&rsquo;t think it will here.</p>
<p>This should be enough of a shared lexicon to get where I&rsquo;m trying to go, or at least to be able to define new terms along the way as necessary.</p>

<p>A couple of years ago I was trying to come up with a username. The kind someone else might have created in high school and stuck with for the next 20 years. I was looking for something that could represent me, wasn&rsquo;t already taken everywhere, and wasn&rsquo;t directly associated with my day job or anything I&rsquo;ve done previously on the internet. Not entirely sure how I stumbled on the word, but &ldquo;<a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/contrariwise">Contrariwise</a>&rdquo; was an instant hit among friends.</p>

<p>Whatever I&rsquo;m thinking about at the moment. I have a bad habit of responding to simple questions with an essay. Sometimes I think it makes sense to just publish the essay instead. I use my blog as something like the intersection between what very small amount of value I used to get out of Twitter, while also still being able to get lengthy when I want to. My experience is that people are busy and they mostly don&rsquo;t click links, so posting links to a blog from a microblog is a great way to make sure your blog never gets read. Having one stream that does both is, I think, the best I can get while still being respectful of other peoples' time and attention.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s not much of a backlog to look at currently, but if you don&rsquo;t know me you might enjoy <a href="https://thewizardly.com/now/">thewizardly.com/now/</a> which is perpetually out of date, but I think a rather good snapshot of my interests. If you also like some of those things, you might like my posts in general.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Is the content you are working on a hobby? Are you an aspiring professional (or already a professional)?</strong></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Let&rsquo;s call it a hobby? I try to keep work entirely out of this stream. It&rsquo;d be neat to make some money doing some of my hobbies someday, but I&rsquo;m also not trying to turn any of them into &ldquo;jobbies.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Do you have any off-duty activities related to the content you are handling?</strong></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>(In the context of Japanese society this question is asking if I do things like vend at conventions related to my hobbies.) Short answer? No.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Please let us know if there are any people or works that you are aiming for in the content you are handling.</strong></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>(In situ this question is basically asking if I&rsquo;m aspiring to emulate anyone.) No. I&rsquo;m striving for authenticity. Not, like, &ldquo;branded authenticity.&rdquo; Actually just my real answers, thoughts, and perspectives. One of the reasons why I want to detach this identity from &ldquo;real me&rdquo; is that it allows me to be more real in every way that matters. The day job requires a brand. It requires emulation. This is more &ldquo;me&rdquo; than most people who ever meet me are likely to get.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Do you have a set update frequency and update time for your site?</strong></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;m trying to post roughly weekly, just to build and maintain the habit. I don&rsquo;t kick myself too hard if it I miss it.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>For what maximum period have you stopped updating?</strong></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Since starting this blog, I think at most a couple of weeks. However I&rsquo;ve gone &ldquo;radio silent&rdquo; on the internet for periods of years in other places.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Would you like to get more visitors?</strong></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Yes, but only inasmuch as I always want to attract more of my tribe. I want more visitors who are legitimately interested in the kinds of things I talk about.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Are you happy with the feedback on the content?</strong></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;m happy with all positive, constructive feedback. Reasonable people should be able to disagree about some things, and I&rsquo;m not particularly interested in the kind of vitriol that&rsquo;s standard in other parts of the internet. It&rsquo;s like we forgot, culturally, that it was possible to walk away and not say anything.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>What do you think about typos and broken links?</strong></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>When I notice them, I fix them, but mistakes are the touch of a human&rsquo;s hand. I fear the world where no mistake is permitted far more than someone judging my typo.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Do you accept requests?</strong></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>I think this is probably intended for someone who has an artistic output. My artistic output is primarily words. I think I&rsquo;d take a suggestion on a topic to write about, if I thought I had anything to say, but I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;d take commissioned writing work.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Are there hidden pages?</strong></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Not intentionally! I think I might have toyed around with some plugins on my host that are still technically enabled, but I haven&rsquo;t hidden anything with the intent of it being found.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Do you have another site?</strong></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Several! All defunct. Haven&rsquo;t figured out what to do about that.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Do you allow links? If so, please let me know if there are any conditions.</strong></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Certainly. I would prefer if links stay within the <a href="https://indieweb.org/">IndieWeb</a>. I won&rsquo;t be entirely crushed if I end up linked somewhere out on the Commercial Web, if the end result of that is meeting more of my tribe.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Did you have any experience running another site before starting this one?</strong></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been running sites since the days of Geocities and Angelfire. It&rsquo;s probably for the best that I couldn&rsquo;t remember where any of those were, though. No idea if I&rsquo;m in <a href="https://archive.org/web/geocities.php">the big Geocities dump</a>. Probably?</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>What inspired you to create this site?</strong></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>I needed a place to be able to get thoughts out of my head but which also would allow me to interact with the <a href="https://indieweb.org/">IndieWeb</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fediverse">Fediverse</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>When was this site established?</strong></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>2023/10/31.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Do you have any celebration plans for the opening anniversary?</strong></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think so! I probably won&rsquo;t even make note of it, if I notice.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Do you keep in mind events such as Halloween and Christmas, seasonal changes, and social trends when updating?</strong></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Not even a little bit. Honestly I sometimes forget to keep those things in mind in day to day life.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Do you use SNS?</strong></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>(&ldquo;SNS&rdquo; is the shorthand term that the Japanese use for &ldquo;social media&rdquo;.) Basically, no. The closest I get is this blog&rsquo;s federation to the Fediverse. You can follow me on Mastodon! I have an account on BlueSky that just reposts everything I post here, to make it easier for people to follow me there until they get <a href="https://atproto.com/guides/overview">ATProtocol</a> fully up and working.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Please tell us why you dare to run a website in this SNS era.</strong></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Because the slow web was a better web. And the small web still is, where it exists and you can find it. Computers are a miracle. We taught sand to think by hitting it with lightning. But that doesn&rsquo;t mean every invention that followed was a net positive for society. I don&rsquo;t think social media actually helps anyone, and I think I&rsquo;d have a pretty high burden of proof to change that prior.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Is there anything you keep in mind when running your site?</strong></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Be honest. Be clear. Be kind. Nobody&rsquo;s ever changed their mind because someone yelled at them.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Is there anything that remains in your mind while running the site?</strong></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>I have a set of principals for engaging with the internet. I&rsquo;ve never written them down. I probably should. It includes not having any kind of intentional tracking on this site. It might be kind of neat to know how many people see it, but I can&rsquo;t preach with one hand that people shouldn&rsquo;t be tracked and then track them. I know that there are services that do a more respectful version of tracking, but I think the correct amount is none. For me and also for everyone else. We should not have opened this pandora&rsquo;s box.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Do you have any problems with site management?</strong></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>No, I pay <a href="https://micro.blog/">micro.blog</a> to do all the hard stuff for me.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Do you ever get embarrassed about content you posted a long time ago and delete it?</strong></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t say I&rsquo;m embarrassed. There&rsquo;s definitely stuff I posted when I was young that is, how they say, &ldquo;cringe&rdquo; by modern standards. It&rsquo;s probably cached in Google and the Wayback machine, if you knew where to look, but I don&rsquo;t. I have never once, in my life, tried to search myself on Google. I think it&rsquo;s probably the correct position, and I&rsquo;d recommend it to everyone.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Have you ever thought about quitting the site?</strong></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Not this one, but I&rsquo;ve basically &ldquo;quit&rdquo; others when they stopped making sense. Some of which were lost forever, which is a shame.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Do you have backups or other measures in place in case your site suddenly disappears?</strong></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Not yet. I&rsquo;m not invested enough that I think it would be a catatrophe. At some point I know I&rsquo;ll need to set up some kind of archival solution for this site.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>If you were to die tomorrow, would you leave your website behind? Do you want to delete it?</strong></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>I think I&rsquo;d want to leave it. I suspect there are people that would come here, read what I typed, and they&rsquo;d hear it in my voice. And for a short period of time I&rsquo;d still be there. I think a piece of us lives on as long as we&rsquo;re still remembered and thought of. It would be real cool to be the kind of person that people think of long after I&rsquo;m gone.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Are you okay if your family or real-life friends and acquaintances see your site?</strong></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>That&rsquo;s probably 90% of who&rsquo;s seeing it.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>How much of a difference do you think there is between your online image and your real-life personality?</strong></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Less than you&rsquo;d imagine. Authenticity is part of the goal. The only place I&rsquo;m anything other than exactly who I am is work.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>What kind of people do you want to visit your site?</strong></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Interesting weirdos. Kind people with strong opinions about making the world a better place and realistic plans for achieving it.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Are you registered for searches or rankings?</strong></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>I think I applied to be listed in an IndieWeb / Personal Blog list, but I never followed up and I have no idea if that ever happened. I could probably get listed on Google but I think it&rsquo;s pretty unlikely I&rsquo;d ever rank on any searches so it&rsquo;s not high up my list.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Are you part of an alliance?</strong></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>(This is the Japanese equivalent of a webring.) No. I don&rsquo;t actually know how much those ever worked, if I&rsquo;m being honest. Someone out there probably used them a lot, but I didn&rsquo;t. Maybe if I found one that really seemed align with my kind of weirdo I&rsquo;d get hooked up, but I&rsquo;m not actively seeking that out.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Do you use templates?</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>The site layout is a template through <a href="https://micro.blog/">micro.blog</a>. I don&rsquo;t use any templates in my post content. I&rsquo;ve thought about it, for something like a weekly review post. Maybe I will at some point.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>How well do you know the languages used to create homepages, such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP?</strong></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;m fluent in all of those things, but prefer not to do it. I haven&rsquo;t written a line of PHP since probably 2006? HTML, CSS, and JS are all more recent, but I&rsquo;d rather not unless I absolutely have to.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>When operating your site, do you ever pay attention to the number of accesses and update frequency of other sites?</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>Not at all. I try not to measure myself against others.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Please let me know if you have any recommendations for sites or books that support site production.</strong></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Look at the source code for sites you think are doing something cool, and see if you can figure out how they did it. Don&rsquo;t steal their entire layout and style, that&rsquo;s what we call Not Cool, but the best way to learn in my experience is to figure out how someone did what you&rsquo;re trying to do.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I back a lot of things on Kickstarter. Like. A lot of things. Especially during the annual <a href="https://updates.kickstarter.com/zine-quest-2023-kickstarters-annual-open-call-for-rpg-zines-returns-in-february/">ZineQuest</a>, where indie TTRPG creators are encouraged to take a chance on the small, wild ideas that sometimes grow up to be Something Big.</p>
<p>At PAX Unplugged I had the chance to speak briefly with one such creator, and they asked me what I looked for when I was deciding to back a project, so this post is written to them. Well. Also you, you&rsquo;re reading it. Hi! But mostly to them, and anyone else who might at some point want to try to publish a TTRPG supplement.</p>
<p>What I&rsquo;d like to do is go through each of the projects I&rsquo;ve decided to back in the <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/discover/advanced?ref=section-zinequest-projectcollection-tag-newest&amp;sort=newest&amp;tag_id=346">2024 ZineQuest</a> and explain why, exactly, it caught my eye. Plus a couple I decided not to back but want to promote. I won&rsquo;t be punching down and talking about anything I decided not to back. That&rsquo;s feedback that might be useful to those specific creators if they ever asked for it, but I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s generally helpful to publish as a list.</p>
<h3 id="first-a-rubric">First, A Rubric</h3>
<p>Essentially I&rsquo;m asking myself three questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Do I think I would ever play it? (Medium-likely.)</li>
<li>Do I think I could convince my friends to play it? (Almost impossible.)</li>
<li>Do I think I could pilfer it for ideas or mechanics? (Most common outcome.)</li>
</ul>
<p>Sometimes there&rsquo;s a few extra points tossed in for &ldquo;I think this idea is really cool and I want it to exist in the world,&rdquo; but you can&rsquo;t optimize for <em>je ne sais quoi</em>.</p>
<h2 id="things-im-backing">Things I&rsquo;m Backing</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/wythe/blister-critters">Blister Critters</a> &ndash; I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ll ever convince my friends to play this, but the art and idea are unique, the presentation is outstanding, and it&rsquo;s entirely unlike the canon of TTRPGs I already own. This is the game I expect people to be copying in ZineQuest 2025.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/robinfjarem/shadow-over-gloomshire">Shadow over Gloomshire</a> &ndash; Five words in the project description were all it took: &ldquo;dark fantasy and gothic horror.&rdquo; This falls into the category of things I&rsquo;m not sure will be directly useful to me, but I want more of it to exist in the world.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/mikelorette/the-lair-of-the-skateomancer">The Lair of the Skateomancer</a> &ndash; I really want to see how the skateboard is implemented as a magic item, and I&rsquo;m interested in the skatepark themed lair. It seems just ridiculous enough to work.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/rightafterthen/radish-quest">Radish Quest</a> &ndash; The art is half of what sold me. Half of the remaining half is that I&rsquo;ve backed another project from this creator before and been happy with it. The remaining half-half is the all-in dedication to the bit in the project description. Radishes.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/moonmax/the-wigmakers-fingers">The Wigmaker&rsquo;s Fingers</a> &ndash; A heist where you steal a prosthetic finger. Everything about the way this is packaged makes me want to know more, and the samples of the layout on the book look great.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/ravensridge/cartograph-atlas-edition-a-solo-mapmaking-ttrpg">Cartograph - Atlas Edition: A Mapmaking TTRPG</a> &ndash; I&rsquo;m interested in the mechanics. Like many TTRPG nerds I someday wish to publish my own world as a supplement, and I&rsquo;m usually interested in systems that I think could help me develop that world.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/residentbard/i-crave-the-loop">I Crave The Loop</a> &ndash; Curious to see how the mechanics work, plus the name and idea are clever.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/crum/details">The Details of Our Escape</a> &ndash; Mostly I want to see how the domino mechanic works, but the art also looks compelling.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/sleepysasquatch/courier-repacked">Courier - Repacked</a> &ndash; The description reads a lot more like a solo board game than a TTRPG to me, so I&rsquo;m curious to see what that&rsquo;s about. It also claims to touch on some interesting ideas, like building a base, and I want to see how that&rsquo;s implemented. I&rsquo;ve always liked the idea of the players being able to make a home, but I find a lot of the mechanics for doing that in traditional TTRPGs to lack depth or interest.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/4randompixels/valheks-guide-to-treasure-hunting">Valhek&rsquo;s Guide to Treasure Hunting</a> &ndash; At $3 the PDF falls squarely into &ldquo;why not&rdquo; territory. It only needs to have one interesting monster or magic item to feel like I&rsquo;ve probably got my money&rsquo;s worth.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/bclev/8-bit-theater-the-roleplaying-game">8-BIT THEATER THE ROLEPLAYING GAME</a> &ndash; Many hundreds of years ago I was an avid reader of 8-Bit Theater. Honestly I&rsquo;m just glad Brian Clevenger is still out there, doing his thing. This is somewhat me just kicking some money to a creator who brought me a lot of joy a very long time ago. It mostly doesn&rsquo;t matter if the product is any good. But it looks like it probably will be, if nothing else, pretty funny.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/hungryfamiliar/bookwyrm-loot-some-books">Bookwyrm: Loot some books!</a> &ndash; Much like Valhek&rsquo;s Guide, the $4 entry price for a PDF of random tables is enough to get it a &ldquo;why not.&rdquo; The concept is cute, and I could probably make use of it in a campaign somewhere.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/scottwegener/cult-of-the-morach-an-old-school-adventure">Cult of the Morach: An Old School Adventure</a> &ndash; Mostly interested to see how the encounter clocks function. That&rsquo;s something I&rsquo;ve done before, and I think it can be a useful way to pace events that happen whether or not the players are paying attention. I&rsquo;m curious to see if there&rsquo;s a better way to do it. The adventure itself looks like it could also be interesting, but it&rsquo;s for a system I don&rsquo;t play, so it&rsquo;s probably going to serve as inspiration and not be something I ever use directly.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/eryksawicki/milk-bar-sci-fi-osr-roleplaying-in-post-communist-poland">Milk Bar: sci-fi roleplaying in post-Soviet Poland</a> &ndash; Once again looking at the base building mechanics, although the setting is also wholly new to me. I didn&rsquo;t know what a Milk Bar was before. The physical edition and layout also looks fantastic.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/dimdayred/dimday-red-ttrpg-nodus-02">Dimday Red TTRPG - Nodus Zine 02</a> &ndash; I backed the original Dimday Red kickstarter in ZineQuest 2023, and I think the world is an interesting one. Mid-apocalyptic catches me in much the same way post-apocalyptic would, but it&rsquo;s a relatively unique take. Stories rarely linger in the middle of the world ending.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/bodieh/mystery-under-magi-mart">Mystery Under Magi-Mart</a> &ndash; I think this might be a fun thing to run as a Line Entertainment [E]nforcer at PAX.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/brookletgames/beetle-knight">Beetle Knight</a> &ndash; You can be a moth.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/johnsonofair/the-tower-a-puzzle-dungeon-crawl">The Tower - A System Agnostic Puzzle Dungeon Crawl</a> &ndash; This hits a few highlights. It&rsquo;s a puzzle/riddle dungeon and it&rsquo;s system agnostic. The kind of thing I&rsquo;m likely to be able to slip into any campaign where it might be useful. Too many supplements want to give me more monsters, but I don&rsquo;t really need more monsters. I have too many already. A good puzzle that players might enjoy solving is hard to come by.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/dngnclub/dngn-club-relics-remastered-vol-1">DNGN CLUB: Relics Remastered Vol. 1</a> &ndash; A kitchen sink of the author&rsquo;s best ideas. Some of the samples are evocative. I&rsquo;m curious to see what can be pilfered.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/9thlevel/sentai-and-sensibility">Sentai &amp; Sensibility RPG</a> &ndash; If you have never wanted to be simultaneously both the green Power Ranger and also Mr Darcy, then I&rsquo;m not entirely certain that we can relate. But if you have, now is your chance.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/gametee/thrifty-trades-of-fey-zine-quest">Thrifty Trades of Fey</a> &ndash; I&rsquo;ve backed just about everything <a href="https://gametee.co.uk/">Gametee</a> have ever made and been delighted by all of it. What particularly caught my eye is the use of an origami fortune teller. I want to see how they make use of it as a mechanic.</p>
<h2 id="things-im-not-backing">Things I&rsquo;m Not Backing</h2>
<p>These are projects that I&rsquo;m not getting for one reason or another, but I think they&rsquo;re cool and maybe you&rsquo;ll be interested.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/aethercorp/field-agent-handbook">Field Agent Handbooks: Observancy Dept. 1924–28</a> &ndash; This is a cool idea, but I know to my teeth that I&rsquo;d never make any use of it. The idea doesn&rsquo;t seem to be pilferable. For the right person this would probably be a lot of fun, I&rsquo;m just not that person.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/josiahmoore/tiny-fables">Tiny Fables</a> &ndash; The art on this is gorgeous, but it&rsquo;s for a system I don&rsquo;t play and don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ll pick up. The examples make it seem like it would be difficult to adapt any of it to the games I do play.</p>

<p>Medium story short, it was originally a work trip. Having never been to Hawaii, or indeed to any &ldquo;tropical&rdquo; or &ldquo;island&rdquo; destination, I tacked on a short mini-vacation the weekend before the work portion. Then the work part got cancelled, and my &ldquo;mini&rdquo; vacation was non-refundable. So, okay. I guess I&rsquo;m going on a short trip to Hawaii. No plans, no friends. Just me and the island.</p>
<h3 id="day-1---wednesday">Day 1 - Wednesday</h3>
<p>I like going places, don&rsquo;t mind flying, but hate airports. The American airport experience is designed to maximize suffering at every touchpoint. With an 8-hour direct flight basically all of Wednesday was dedicated to the trip. Here I want to shout out to American Airlines' premium economy, which made the experience significantly more comfortable. I&rsquo;d say it&rsquo;s roughly equivalent to Alaska Airlines' first class. The seats alone are worth the price of admission.</p>
<p>When I stepped off the airplane, however, I felt the first moist slap of Hawaiian air and&hellip; Well. Have you ever heard of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_syndrome">Paris syndrome</a>? The short version is that Paris is nothing at all like how it&rsquo;s presented in the movies, and when some people experience it &ldquo;in the flesh&rdquo; for the first time the delta between expectation and reality leads to a bunch of negative symptoms.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t say it was exactly like that, but expectation definitely didn&rsquo;t match reality. I can&rsquo;t explain why it never occurred to me that Hawaii would be hot and humid, but it&rsquo;s not what I was prepared for. Mentally, physically, emotionally, financially. In retrospect the fact that I even wore a hoodie now strikes me as hilariously unprepared. But also I didn&rsquo;t even bring a pair of shorts.</p>
<p>So I caught a Lyft to my hotel in Waikiki, turned the air conditioning as low as it could possibly go, and ordered <a href="https://www.hawaiianbarbecue.com/">L&amp;L</a> on a delivery app. Wednesday was a write-off. I was asleep no later than 8pm Hawaiian time, though I think it may have been much closer to 6:30.</p>
<h3 id="day-2---thursday">Day 2 - Thursday</h3>
<p>I woke up at 6am local time on this and every other day of my trip. No alarm. Apparently that&rsquo;s just when my body has decided it&rsquo;s time to get up these days. Side note to myself I wonder if there&rsquo;s something useful I could do with that information WRT my work schedule? Something to think about.</p>
<p>Breakfast at the hotel. Perfectly acceptable. Usual hotel price gouging for usual hotel quality. Then I set off to explore. I decided to head East first because Maps showed a nearby Point of Interest, the Stones of Life.</p>
<img src="https://thewizardly.com/uploads/2024/image.jpg" class="pure-img" alt="A plaque stating “Please respect this cultural site of reverence. There are many stories of these four healers from Tahiti, known for duality of male and female spirit and their wondrous works of healing.”">

<p>Continuing in that direction for a mile I saw most of the sandy parts of Waikiki, a couple really nice parks, and some chickens. Getting away from the hustle and bustle of &ldquo;the strip&rdquo; was nice, but I drenched my shirt through with sweat due to the humidity. On my way back I stopped at the ABC Store and picked up some coconut water before spending the majority of the day in my hotel room to enjoy the air conditioning and a book.</p>
<p>Dinner was a tour of spam musubi from just about every place I could think of to get one. L&amp;L remains the gold standard as far as I&rsquo;m concerned.</p>
<h3 id="day-3---friday">Day 3 - Friday</h3>
<p>Once again up at 6am I decided to strike out West and see the other half of Waikiki, including a tour of the Royal Hawaiian mall. I found a local malasada place and brought them back to my hotel&rsquo;s (not yet open) beach bar, where they were greatly enjoyed. I watched a series of three catamarans beach themselves, which was shocking and unexpected the first time but which I now gather is a fairly common way of parking there. Still wild to see a 30' boat ram itself into the beach at what feels like much too high a velocity.</p>
<img src="https://thewizardly.com/uploads/2024/camphoto-1254324197.jpeg" class="pure-img" alt="A yellow catamaran sailboat parked directly on the beach.">
<p>Heading back from malasadas I picked up the local transit card, something I do most places I visit, and I made use of that for the afternoon by heading to a local hobby shop. Pretty much everywhere I go, if there&rsquo;s time, I&rsquo;ll hit up the local hobby shops. Sometimes there&rsquo;s interesting things there. Nothing grabbed my attention this time, but the trip back went by <a href="https://www.iolanipalace.org/">Iolani Palace</a> so I hopped off the bus and took a look around. The only way to go in was a paid audio tour, so I didn&rsquo;t. I love to wander at my own discretion but mostly don&rsquo;t enjoy being lead around. The grounds were still spectacular.</p>
<img src="https://thewizardly.com/uploads/2024/img-9982.jpeg" class="pure-img" alt="Iolani palace at the end of a paved avenue bordered on both sides by palm trees.">

<p>I think this might have been the night I had the fish sandwich for dinner at the hotel&rsquo;s beach bar. The fish itself was great, but every other decision the chef made was questionable. This is a theme that would repeat both times I ate a meal at the beach bar. The virgin riptide, essentially a minty pina colada, was amazing.</p>
<h3 id="day-4---saturday">Day 4 - Saturday</h3>
<p>Up and out and on the bus, I decided to visit <a href="https://byodo-in.com/">Byodo-In Temple</a> which remains the highlight of the trip. Somewhere in the multiverse there&rsquo;s the version of me who figured out young enough that it was possible to just&hellip; Go become a monk. Probably that version of me is the best version of me. The only thing I did not love about my time at Byodo-In was the behavior of other tourists. Be respectful.</p>
<img src="https://thewizardly.com/uploads/2024/img-9990.jpeg" class="pure-img" alt="A large temple complex nestled among green trees.">
<p>Back on the bus and off to the island&rsquo;s other hobby shop. They didn&rsquo;t have anything I&rsquo;d be interested in, but I&rsquo;m always glad to see small businesses making their dream work. And they recommended a local Thai restaurant on the windward side of the island that had the best panang curry I&rsquo;ve ever eaten, which was also the best thing I had on the entire trip.</p>
<p>In for a penny in for a pound I caught the bus again and rode it all the way around the northern tip of the island, a 2.5 hour trip that left me in <a href="https://www.gohawaii.com/islands/oahu/regions/north-shore">North Shore</a> around mid-afternoon. The whole town has surf bum and artsy jewelry aunt vibes. I grabbed my first and only <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawaiian_shave_ice">shave ice</a> of the trip at <a href="https://matsumotoshaveice.com/">Matsumoto&rsquo;s</a> and would recommend everything about the experience to anyone stuck on Oahu and looking for a place to go.</p>
<p>The bus trip back was another 2.5 hours, this time across the center of the island. In total I spent about 6 hours on the bus on Saturday, for a total daily cost of about $7.50. Not bad when you otherwise have nowhere else to be and all the time in the world to get there.</p>
<p>Dinner was a sushi roll and a big plate of fruit from the ABC store.</p>
<h3 id="day-5---sunday">Day 5 - Sunday</h3>
<p>My last day on the Island, I walked back to the malasada place to get another, and spent my day idling around the hotel. In my room as late as I could, and then on the veranda.</p>
<p>The flight back home was to be a redeye. I&rsquo;ve only ever been forced into an overnight flight two or three times in my life, each of them miserable, and this was no exception. I can&rsquo;t sleep on my back, which means I can&rsquo;t sleep. Earplugs, eye mask, pajama pants. I did everything I could think of to try to improve the experience, but there&rsquo;s no getting around how miserable it was.</p>
<p>Landed at home around 6am Monday morning (today!) drove the hour and a half back from the airport, and then crashed and slept late into the afternoon.</p>
<h3 id="final-thoughts">Final Thoughts</h3>
<p>So was it worth it?</p>
<p>No. Absolutely not. I went lots of places, did lots of things, because that&rsquo;s a better use of my time than being mopey about it, but make no mistake. <a href="https://thewizardly.com/2024/02/01/im-about-to.html">My initial thoughts about Hawaii</a> still hold. I don&rsquo;t understand the person who willingly goes there, we&rsquo;re optimizing for very different things in our life.</p>
<p>I hope to spend the rest of my life at latitudes greater than 35°. North or South. I&rsquo;ll suffer through a long flight if New Zealand awaits me at the end. But the tropics aren&rsquo;t for me, and I hope never to be back.</p>

			 <p>I’m about to say something you might find shocking, so before I do I want to make two things clear:</p>
<ul>
<li>This isn’t a complaint post. The purpose is not to vent.</li>
<li>I actually consider this a positive and optimistic thought process.</li>
</ul>
<p>Okay. Ready?</p>
<h2 id="i-dont-like-hawaii">I don’t like Hawaii</h2>
<p>I’ll wait a moment for the outrage to subside.</p>
<p>Nothing at all against the residents or people. I’ve traveled a lot and my experience is that people, broadly, are kind and welcoming.</p>
<p>I’m here, right now, as I type this, having breakfast under an umbrella in Waikiki, and I have realized that this place is my definition of hell on earth.</p>
<p>And here’s the kicker, I think that’s a good thing. I’ve never been more happy to be unhappy! So I thought it would be worth unpacking what’s up.</p>
<h2 id="travel-preferences">Travel Preferences</h2>
<p>I’m a creature of the cold climates. I originated in the Pacific Northwest, and I crave nothing so much as a cool drizzle in a quiet forest.</p>
<p>January should be the depths of winter in Hawaii. It’s presumably as cold as it gets around here. To my tastes it’s too warm. Not just too warm, but simultaneously too humid. I’ve been in a place that is both warm and humid enough times to realize that I always find this experience miserable.</p>
<ul>
<li>If it’s going to be hot, I want it to be dry.</li>
<li>If it’s going to be wet, I want it to be cold.</li>
<li>If it’s going to be hot and wet, I want it to be Disney world.</li>
</ul>
<p>I’m willing to tolerate the climate for Disney. It’s an exception that proves the rule.</p>
<p>I’ve realized something I probably should have figured out a long time ago. My idea of paradise isn’t a tropical island with a fruity drink, it isn’t sand, it isn’t the ocean.</p>
<p>Paradise is a cabin in the woods, plush rugs, a roaring fire, and snow outside the window. It’s Estes Park, CO in February. It’s Walden Pond.</p>
<p>I’m having a miserable time, but I’m actually happy about it, because now I know something important about myself. And now I’m excited for all the trips I can plan with that knowledge in mind.</p>

			 <p>I finished <a href="">Roots of Pacha</a> at a little over 50 hours of total play time. I still wouldn&rsquo;t recommend it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But random internet wizard, what would you recommend?&rdquo; I hear you cry.</p>
<h1 id="contrariwises-definitive-and-not-at-all-biased-guide-to-cozy-sim-games">Contrariwise&rsquo;s Definitive and Not At All Biased Guide to Cozy Sim Games</h1>
<h2 id="not-sweaty">Not Sweaty</h2>
<h3 id="1-stardew-valleyhttpsstoresteampoweredcomapp413150stardew_valley">1) <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/413150/Stardew_Valley/">Stardew Valley</a></h3>
<p>I&rsquo;ve played Stardew all the way through to completion twice. I&rsquo;ll probably play it again someday. Many of its best ideas are now fully dispersed into the cozy sim game ecosystem, but few games really do it as thoroughly and as well. I have basically two notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Stop trying to make fishing mini games. They don&rsquo;t work. I would be tempted to say nobody likes these, because nobody I&rsquo;ve met likes them, but everything is somebody&rsquo;s thing so I&rsquo;m certain that somebody out there lives for the incredibly bland experience of staring at a screen waiting for a pixel to change. Seriously. Stop it.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;m not really a fan of the relationship mechanic where you have to go talk to everyone once a day, or remember when characters' birthdays are, or remember what their favorite gifts are. I&rsquo;m less critical of this one than fishing, because I fully admit this is just my preference whereas I think fishing minigames are a true blight that should be stricken from the catalogue of game mechanics.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-graveyard-keeperhttpsstoresteampoweredcomapp599140graveyard_keeper">2) <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/599140/Graveyard_Keeper/">Graveyard Keeper</a></h3>
<p>This is by far my favorite cozy sim game. I love the macabre setting, I love the mechanics. You don&rsquo;t spend nearly as much time keeping the namesake graveyard as the title might lead you to believe, and I think that&rsquo;s the source of some of its less favorable reviews, but if you&rsquo;re willing to set that aside the mechanical process of playing the game is a delight. My one complaint is that the UI/UX are a bit cumbersome playing on a controller, but that&rsquo;s it. Otherwise 10/10, perfect game.</p>
<h3 id="3-animal-crossinghttpsanimalcrossingnintendocom">3) <a href="https://animalcrossing.nintendo.com/">Animal Crossing</a></h3>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard to know what to even say about Animal Crossing. I feel like if somehow you don&rsquo;t already know this game is for you it probably isn&rsquo;t. It&rsquo;s at its most fun if everyone you know is also playing, so there&rsquo;s a huge incentive to get the new game when it first comes out and play it with your friends. The long tail of being the only person you know still playing Animal Crossing doesn&rsquo;t pass the vibe check. If you haven&rsquo;t played New Horizons yet, now isn&rsquo;t the time to start, but keep an eye out for announcements of a new version and hop on the bandwagon early for maximum enjoyment. Minor quibbles include:</p>
<ul>
<li>I wish they would focus on fewer, higher quality interactions with villagers. Having 100+ possible shades of animal person that only share 16 possible sets of dialogue doesn&rsquo;t do much for me.</li>
<li>New Horizons was needlessly punishing about the rarity of some furniture spawns. I got bored and gave up before collecting some of the sets I wanted for various rooms. There&rsquo;s only so many days I&rsquo;m willing to launch a game and not see any new content. I realize there&rsquo;s a limit on the total amount of content they could ever include, but there are sets I know for a fact existed in the game where no piece ever dropped for me, while I had seen 5+ repeats on the ones that did.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="slightly-sweaty">Slightly Sweaty</h2>
<h3 id="1-valheimhttpsstoresteampoweredcomapp892970valheim">1) <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/892970/Valheim/">Valheim</a></h3>
<p>On the face of it, Valheim is a game I wouldn&rsquo;t expect to enjoy. And if I had played it solo, I probably wouldn&rsquo;t have. However, in concert with someone who actually enjoyed the combat mechanics where I was mostly free to tend my garden and organize storage chests I had a lot of fun. This could be a good game for you if you either don&rsquo;t mind the combat parts or can get someone else to do them.</p>
<h3 id="2-minecrafthttpswwwminecraftnet">2) <a href="https://www.minecraft.net">Minecraft</a></h3>
<p>For what it&rsquo;s worth, I prefer modded Minecraft. It&rsquo;s at its best as a playground for ideas and mechanics that aren&rsquo;t quite enough to be a game on their own. I haven&rsquo;t played since probably 1.12, and I think they&rsquo;ve made the combat sweatier in ways I would not enjoy, so this has fallen in my ranking to near the bottom of things I might recommend. Ask me a decade ago and it likely would have been the top. It&rsquo;s hard to recommend a specific modpack, because they change frequently and I&rsquo;m now several years out from having looked, but the place I&rsquo;d start today would be to see if <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/direwolf20">Direwolf20</a> is still kicking around. Whatever he&rsquo;s playing.</p>
<h1 id="games-that-sometimes-people-think-i-would-like-but-i-dont-because-theyre-too-sweaty">Games That Sometimes People Think I would Like But I Don&rsquo;t Because They&rsquo;re Too Sweaty</h1>
<h3 id="1-terrariahttpsstoresteampoweredcomapp105600terraria">1) <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/105600/Terraria/">Terraria</a></h3>
<p>It&rsquo;s not for me. I&rsquo;ve tried maybe 2-3 times, and I don&rsquo;t enjoy the mechanics. I also think it&rsquo;s sweaty. Terraria is Minecraft for people that want harder combat and more things to kill. No shade if this is your game, but it&rsquo;s not mine.</p>
<h3 id="2-starboundhttpsstoresteampoweredcomapp211820starbound">2) <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/211820/Starbound/">Starbound</a></h3>
<p>This is Terraria in space. I don&rsquo;t like it for all the same reasons, despite the fact that it&rsquo;s in space. I usually like space, but space won&rsquo;t save a game I don&rsquo;t otherwise enjoy.</p>
<hr>
<p>That&rsquo;s it. That&rsquo;s the list. There are other sim games out there, cozy or otherwise, but I don&rsquo;t feel the need to comment. Possibly I haven&rsquo;t had the chance to play them. Possibly I know I wouldn&rsquo;t like them for some of the reasons I&rsquo;ve already attributed above.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not really looking for recommendations for games at this time, I barely have any time to play them and I&rsquo;ve committed to not buying anything new until the backlog is clear, but hopefully this helps someone figure out what to play next. Or at least what not to play next.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;ve been away from home the last two weeks, give or take, smushing some personal travel together with some business travel to minimize my &ldquo;suffering per airport hour&rdquo; statistic as much as possible. If work&rsquo;s going to pay for me to go somewhere, I&rsquo;m going to try and get a mini-vacation out of it. I&rsquo;m home for what feels like seven seconds, before heading back out on another mini-vaction-turned-actual-vacation next week.</p>
<p>What started out as the pre-vacation of a work trip became a vacation-vacation when the work portion of the trip got cancelled but my hotel was non-refundable. So now I&rsquo;m going to Hawaii, and I know this is going to sound like crazy talk from someone who barely manages to sound sane most of the time, but in a perfect world I wish I weren&rsquo;t. It&rsquo;s a long flight for a relatively short stay in the fanciest and most expensive hotel I&rsquo;ve ever personally booked on my own dime.</p>
<p>At least it&rsquo;s all pre-paid.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m planning to use it as a chance to relax on a beach, like I&rsquo;ve always said I wanted to, combined with my first quarter check-in / personal retreat. I&rsquo;ll be barely just one month into the <a href="https://thewizardly.com/2023/12/31/its-the-last.html">Year of Scales and Arpeggios</a>, so I&rsquo;m not entirely certain what a check-in will look like. But hey. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwux9KiBMjE">Beach</a>.</p>
<h2 id="other-updates">Other Updates</h2>
<ul>
<li>I finished <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1868140/DAVE_THE_DIVER/">DAVE THE DIVER</a>. Once I turned on the accessibility setting that removed frantic button tapping, I found it a lot more approachable. I hope this trend of accessibility settings to turn off the parts of games I find obnoxious continues.</li>
<li>I started playing <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1245560/Roots_of_Pacha/">Roots of Pacha</a>. This is the most time I&rsquo;ve ever spent on a game that I wouldn&rsquo;t recommend. It&rsquo;s a prehistoric Stardew clone, and while it has some interesting ideas I think it fails to execute on the best of them while retaining the parts I like least from the overall genre. I tried to refund it after my first hour of playing and was denied because I had owned it for too many weeks. If I could go back, I&rsquo;d still get it refunded. Nevertheless I&rsquo;ve somehow managed to spend almost 40 hours on it? A lot of that time I think was me waiting to see if it would pay off on its premise, and I&rsquo;m now deep enough to say that no it doesn&rsquo;t but I might as well see my investment through to the end of its story.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;m also back on <a href="https://www.fallenlondon.com/">Fallen London</a>, which is great. If you, too, would like to be stolen by bats, I&rsquo;m looking for friends to infest with rats.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;m currently watching <a href="https://thetvdb.com/series/tales-from-the-crypt">Tales from the Crypt</a> for the first time as an adult. It almost entirely stands up all these years later, and I would put it in the pantheon of one of the best shows ever made.</li>
<li>Somehow someone let me sign up to be a Librarian for <a href="https://hardcover.app/">Hardcover</a> which mostly entails updating the details of books. I don&rsquo;t anticipate this being a major ongoing commitment, but I&rsquo;m detail-oriented and plan to at the very least update the books that I&rsquo;m personally reading and tracking. If you&rsquo;re looking to not be on Goodreads anymore, the app and community and vibe are all excellent.</li>

			 <p>As part of the Year of Scales and Arpeggios I find myself needing to keep track of new things in new ways. The problem is that tracking things, like naming them, is hard. Maybe it&rsquo;s less hard for people that don&rsquo;t suffer from perfectionism. It&rsquo;s hard for me. The ideal system is one which tracks itself, but those are few and far between and rarely support the other principles that matter to me.</p>
<p>One of the things I want to improve on is how much time I spend on my hobbies. To be clear: it&rsquo;s currently not enough. I would like to spend more time on my hobbies. But I&rsquo;ve got a lot of other things competing for my time, and that means left to my own devices I won&rsquo;t naturally spend more time working on the things that I want to work on. So I&rsquo;m tracking it. Currently the form of that tracking is a daily tick box in my 2024 Hobonichi Techo Cousin. Pro: it&rsquo;s flexible to my needs. Con: it&rsquo;s hard to remember to look in the planner.</p>
<p>I suppose I could talk about planners in general, the problem being that I absolutely adore the tactile feel of paper, but I don&rsquo;t find it very useful to try to manage my mostly-digital life with mostly-analog tools. There&rsquo;s occasionally value in enforcing the gap, and I think that I think better &ldquo;on paper,&rdquo; but I know that trying to move my calendar or todo list to paper would be foolhardy at best and catastrophic at worst.</p>
<p>So, better or worse, I&rsquo;ve got a paper planner that I mostly don&rsquo;t use for traditional planning. But it gives me room to explore the space. Maybe these checkboxes are the path forward, maybe they&rsquo;re not, but they&rsquo;re much easier to change if I figure out something better than if I doubled-down on an app-based solution that would only ever work &ldquo;how it works,&rdquo; and likely require me to test 3-5 different apps to find the one that worked the way I needed it to. In my experience, apps are rarely a solution to any problems. They are frequently the problem I&rsquo;m attempting to solve.</p>
<p>Last week&rsquo;s boxes were:</p>
<ul>
<li>Up by 8</li>
<li>Morning planning</li>
<li>Apple rings</li>
<li>40K</li>
<li>Reading</li>
<li>Sleep</li>
</ul>
<p>I&rsquo;ve already reworked that to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Awake on time</li>
<li>30 minute walk</li>
<li>Hobby</li>
<li>Reading</li>
<li>Asleep on time</li>
</ul>
<p>Most days I want to be up by 8, but not all, so generalizing the check makes it easier to set up my planner each week. A checkmark for whether or not I closed all my apple rings is somewhat redundant, since I can look that up at any time. Much more useful is to track whether I engaged in the behaviors that lead to the desired result. &ldquo;Hobby&rdquo; remains to be seen if it meets the need. The main hobby I want to do more of is Warhammer 40K, but it&rsquo;s not my only hobby and there are nights where I have commitments or obligations that consume the time I might otherwise spend. I suspect that one will change again, even though I don&rsquo;t yet know how I&rsquo;d change it.</p>
<p>Reading deserves a special call-out. Arguably, it&rsquo;s a hobby, but it&rsquo;s one I&rsquo;ve struggled to maintain to my own satisfaction for nearly 20 years. In high school I was voracious, not least of which because I was often ignoring the teachers. I wish I had something approximating Goodreads data for how many books I used to read, but subjectively I&rsquo;d estimate a 2x-3x over my best year as an adult. I&rsquo;ve had the best luck setting aside time before bed to read, so that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ve done again, and that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m tracking. And then, to make sure I don&rsquo;t accidentally forget to sleep because &ldquo;just one more chapter,&rdquo; I track that I lay down to sleep on time. Midnight, for the curious.</p>
<p>I like that paper gives me the freedom to try to figure out the best way to track this. And it&rsquo;s a physical object in the world that&rsquo;s harder to accidentally forget to update. Most importantly it&rsquo;s a place to start. Starting is often the hardest part.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>It&rsquo;s the last day of the <strong>Year of Time</strong>, and I think of it broadly as a success. I&rsquo;ve cut my commitments to the bare minimum, and for the first time in forever have been making solid progress on self care and relaxation as a goal. Most nights, after work, there hasn&rsquo;t been more work.</p>
<p>The Steam Deck has been life changing, being a system perfect for the playing of games and almost nothing else. My computers have always been full of too many non-gaming temptations to be effective gaming machines, even when they were very much built with that express purpose in mind.</p>
<p>Now I notice all the little places where previously robust systems have been allowed to atrophy. I don&rsquo;t cook my own meals as often, I don&rsquo;t get out for as many walks, books remain un-read, hobbies find themselves un-pursued. Foundations need to be relaid. It&rsquo;s time to build again.</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s next?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say you were going to learn to play the piano this year. If you learn to play from a teacher, you&rsquo;ll likely follow a fairly familiar pattern: learn the structure of the instrument, the names of the keys, the location of middle C. Then the structure of a chord, how certain keys played together relate to each other. You&rsquo;d learn to play a few songs you hadn&rsquo;t thought of since grade school.</p>
<p>And then you&rsquo;d reach the point that breaks most people: you&rsquo;d learn your scales and arpeggios.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;d play the same series of notes over, and over, and over, moving up the scale, then down the scale, then up and down the scale, then up and down the next scale starting a single key higher. It would not sound like music. It would sound like the scene in every movie where the child is learning piano and the parent is out of their mind with the monotony of the same notes over and over and over.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s awful, and you&rsquo;d likely hate it. Most people do. But here&rsquo;s the thing: it&rsquo;s critically important. The repeated routine of the mundane is what gets you to excellence. All the while your fingers are repeating those same notes they&rsquo;re building familiarity with how to move between the keys, what it feels like. Muscles and memory are strengthening together. You&rsquo;re creating the conditions that will someday allow you to fly, but for today you must walk. And walk. And walk.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never met anyone that enjoys the process of playing scales and arpeggios, but the end result is Beethoven. Mozart. Chopin. Through the regular and routine practice of the basics, comes mastery.</p>
<h1 id="the-year-of-scales-and-arpeggios">The Year of Scales and Arpeggios</h1>
<p>My theme for 2024 is to develop mastery of the mundane. To build the foundations and implement the systems that look like walking today, none of which are flashy or fun, that I believe will allow me to someday fly. It&rsquo;s time to focus on the beautiful execution of the basic and the boring.</p>
<p>What does that look like in practice? Here&rsquo;s a few of the things I&rsquo;m thinking about currently.</p>
<ul>
<li>Options require decisions, decisions create opportunity cost. Remove options everywhere I can. Build and follow routines for anything important.</li>
<li>If it&rsquo;s worth doing, it&rsquo;s worth doing every day. 15 minutes a day adds up to a little more than 80 hours a year, or two standard American work weeks. I can get a lot done in 80 hours if I try.</li>
<li>The simple thing I can actually do reliably will always beat the complicated thing that works occasionally, or for limited duration.</li>
</ul>
<p>And here&rsquo;s a few of my tentative plans for the new year:</p>
<ul>
<li>Wake up at least an hour before work starts, use 30 minutes of that time to walk on my treadmill while also doing daily planning. Stealing that idea almost entirely from CGP Grey, but it seems like a good one.</li>
<li>Systematize meal planning. I&rsquo;d like to create a series of week-long &ldquo;menus&rdquo; that can be rotated, where what we need to buy and what we&rsquo;re going to eat on any given night are already planned from the meals I know we like. The weekend is a great chance to experiment with new things, because I enjoy cooking, but I don&rsquo;t really want to be trying new things on a busy weeknight.</li>
<li>Get real serious about the least serious sport. It&rsquo;s time to really learn to play disc golf.</li>
</ul>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>A couple days belated, but last week was primarily about the run-up to Christmas. My routine for the last several weeks has been to wrap up dinner then settle on the couch with my Steam Deck, play something, and have a movie on in the background. I think as a result I&rsquo;ve seen more movies in December than the preceding decade.</p>
<p>In alphabetical order:</p>
<ul>
<li>8-Bit Christmas (2021)</li>
<li>A Christmas Story (1983)</li>
<li>Emmet Otter&rsquo;s Jug-Band Christmas (1977)</li>
<li>Frosty the Snowman (1969)</li>
<li>Groundhog Day (1993)</li>
<li>Home Alone (1990)</li>
<li>How the Grinch Stole Christmas (2000)</li>
<li>Klaus (2019)</li>
<li>The Muppet Christmas Carol (1992)</li>
<li>Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer (1964)</li>
<li>The Santa Clause (1994)</li>
<li>Scrooged (1988)</li>
<li>Silent Night, Deadly Night (1984)</li>
<li>Silent Night, Deadly Night Part 2 (1987)</li>
<li>A Very Murray Christmas (2015)</li>
<li>White Christmas (1954)</li>
</ul>
<p>I have thoughts about most of them, but I think I can summarize and say that the only one I for sure wouldn&rsquo;t watch a second time is the original Silent Night, Deadly Night, and that&rsquo;s because the first 30-45 minutes of Part 2 are a direct re-telling of the original. That was a fun back-to-back watch one night.</p>
<p>The other thing I noticed is that Rudolph has some interesting and unintended cultural commentary. It&rsquo;s a film that I don&rsquo;t think would get made today, and not just because it&rsquo;s claymation. The premise that someone should be ostracized because of a small physical difference that has no bearing at all on their abilities basically doesn&rsquo;t play in our society anymore, for good reason. That this was ever considered &ldquo;acceptable,&rdquo; I think, explains a lot about my parents' generation. But I&rsquo;ll always stan the island of misfit toys.</p>
<p>While watching all these movies I mostly played Dave the Diver, which I would give something in the neighborhood of 80%. It&rsquo;s basically a series of minigames wrapped in a roguelike. Which are all words that generally would not recommend a game to me. However, there&rsquo;s a lot of charm, the roguelike parts are mostly not awful and only punishing when you &ldquo;lose,&rdquo; which very quickly becomes easy to not do.</p>
<p>Most of the minigames are only forced on you once, and then become entirely optional for replay. And it&rsquo;s impressive for the sheer breadth of how many different kinds of games they snuck in. In later stages it&rsquo;s variously a Tomagatchi, a business simulator, a rhythm game, and a bullet hell. It&rsquo;s like the developers tossed the entire kitchen sink at it, with enough fidelity that they all feel like honest representations of their genre. I didn&rsquo;t exactly enjoy most of them, because they&rsquo;re not genres I would have wanted to play, but I did enjoy the framing of them in the context of a silly little sushi game, and none of them went on so long or were so difficult that they roadblocked the rest of the experience. Probably the best $20 I&rsquo;ve spent on Steam in 2023.</p>

			 <p>I quietly set the goal of spending no money for a week and almost managed to do it. There’s nearly enough food in the house that if I’m clever I don’t need to supplement much to make a week’s worth of meals. Even though we ended up making a few grocery runs, we avoided eating out so I’m still calling it a success.</p>
<p>Heading into 2024 I’m wondering how long I can extend the concept. A no-buy month? A no-buy <strong>year</strong>? I don’t think I could get much beyond a month without needing a proper grocery run, but how many other things could I get by without buying?</p>
<p>I started winding down my comics hobby, and I’m going to let the ones that I’m already technically in the middle of finish out their runs. It’ll probably the next six months for final issues to land. Probably another six months after that to catch up on the backlog.</p>
<p>Also made some progress on migrating to a new project management system for Warhammer. Since I have a bad habit of putting down half-finished work I need a way to remember what’s done on a model. YouTrack feels like 80% of Jira, but the right 80%. It’s almost suspiciously pleasant to use. I’ve got about 10% of the data entry done, enough to kick the tires and know it probably move the rest over the next couple of weeks.</p>

			 <p><strong>If</strong> your primary concern is getting people together at a table to play at all, pick D&amp;D 5E. Everyone knows how to play it, it can be molded to meet the needs of any table, and there are countless off the shelf supplements already available to help a current or aspiring Dungeon Master.</p>
<p>The reality for many people is that it doesn&rsquo;t matter which TTRPG system they use, because the struggle is going to be getting four or more adults together in a room for two or more hours in the first place. Under those conditions, the path of least resistance is the correct path, and that is almost always going to mean D&amp;D 5E. There is nothing wrong with making this choice. It&rsquo;s more important that you have fun with your friends engaging with a hobby you love than just about any other consideration.</p>
<p><strong>If</strong>, on the other hand, your primary concern is literally anything else, then there is always going to be a better system to choose than D&amp;D 5E. The reality is that it doesn&rsquo;t matter how you choose to define &ldquo;better&rdquo; in this case, there&rsquo;s going to be something that rises to the bar. The so-called &ldquo;world&rsquo;s most popular tabletop RPG&rdquo; got there in the same way that Kleenex became the most well-known facial tissue. It is the lowest common denominator. Ubiquitous. Acceptable, though not aspirational. D&amp;D is &ldquo;good enough&rdquo; most of the time. But if you have the time and the inclination, you can do better.</p>
<p>Someone out there has lovingly crafted a TTRPG system perfectly tailored to tell the kind of story you want to tell, and they want nothing more than for you to experience it and find joy. The only limit is the amount of time you can spend trying to find it and whether you can convince your friends to play it.</p>

			 <p>Resisting the urge to wait until I know exactly what I want to say before saying anything.</p>
<p>Spent the day on the couch playing <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1868140/DAVE_THE_DIVER/">Dave the Diver</a> which I did not like at first, but which I think gets better, and watching Christmas movies. It&rsquo;s a rare treat to get to spend a weekend day doing basically nothing, by which I mean doing only what sounds nice in a relaxing manner.</p>
<p>Speaking of Christmas movies, I watched <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CI-YWRK0VPo">8-Bit Christmas</a> for the first time, and it ended up being deeply touching. I cried. I think the premise is maybe a 6/10, but the execution has a lot of heart. If it sounds even remotely like something you might enjoy, it has my stamp of recommendation.</p>
<p>With two weeks left in the Year of Time, I&rsquo;ve got one last cut to make. It&rsquo;s time to say goodbye to comic books. I&rsquo;ve done a terrible job of keeping up with them since I picked the hobby back up in May 2022, and rather than let them slowly continue to pile up in the living room I&rsquo;m going to wind it down so that I can focus more on my keystone hobby goals for 2024. This Tyranid army isn&rsquo;t going to paint itself.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s pretty clear that I still have at least three major time-sink hobbies, and I estimate that I could probably keep up with maybe two of them. One of the following probably needs to go:</p>
<ul>
<li>Warhammer 40K (unlikely)</li>
<li>TTRPGs (unlikely)</li>
<li>Lorcana (&hellip; possibly.)</li>
</ul>
<p>Lorcana doesn&rsquo;t take up that much time at the moment, because in practice I don&rsquo;t actually play it. I&rsquo;m collecting cards on the chance that a future version of me decides it&rsquo;s more fun than the other options currently taking up that time. There exists a future version of me who wishes the current version of me were doing this, and until I&rsquo;m certain I won&rsquo;t become that person it&rsquo;s cheap insurance. But I fully acknowledge I&rsquo;m not actually doing anything with the cards at the moment.</p>
