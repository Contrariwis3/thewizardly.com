		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Full disclosure for those who know me well. I’ll sometimes start with a provocative statement and all the reasons I know I shouldn’t do something only to arrive at: “but YOLO here we go anyway!”</p>
<p>This time, I think, that’s not the destination. This isn’t me secretly explaining why I’m going to start a MUD in the Year of our <a href="https://us.gashapon.jp/">Holy Gashapon</a>, 2026. Probably. Maybe. Almost certainly.</p>
<h3 id="but-first-i-digress">But First, I Digress</h3>
<p>I like people. Here we must start before all else, because otherwise it might start to sound like I’m a misanthrope. I really truly do like people. I like chatting with my friends. I enjoy whiling away the hours in pleasant company.</p>
<p>The computer programs available to do that on the modern internet? They do not spark joy. Unjoyful™. Joyn’t™.</p>
<p>What I’m left with is a bit of a problem. I want to be able to communicate with the diaspora of friendshapes I’ve made over my many decades on the Information Superhighway™, but the tools at my disposal leave much to be desired.</p>
<h4 id="a-brief-litany-on-the-topic-of-instant-messengers">A Brief Litany On The Topic of Instant Messengers</h4>
<p>If, like me, you are old enough to remember the invention of the wheel, you may remember that once upon a time the wild grasslands were cavorted-upon by beasts known as Instant Messengers. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AIM_(software)">AIM</a>. YIM. MSN. <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/05/rip-icq-remembering-a-classic-messaging-app-that-was-way-ahead-of-its-time/">ICQ</a>. While there were slight differences, they all shared the feature that you had to <strong>log on</strong>. Being available to chat was a decision. An action. If the app was open it was an <strong>invitation</strong>.</p>
<p>What happened if the app wasn’t open? Nothing. You didn’t get to talk to that person. You waited for them to be available. When they logged on no messages would be waiting. Each session was a fresh exploration of the social strata.</p>
<p>It was beautiful, and it was perfect, and we <em>killed it.</em></p>
<h3 id="how-to-contact-friends-these-days-in-10-steps-with-pictureshttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvtrctqzn74yk"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TRcTQZN74yk">How To Contact Friends These Days in 10 Steps (with pictures)</a></h3>
<p>Currently there are four different messengers where I maintain a presence, which is exactly three more than I’d ideally like.</p>
<ul>
<li>Signal: the upstart. My most security-conscious friends are here. Often in addition to at least one other place. This is the place I’ve tried to center, and the platform I’m most likely to respond on.</li>
<li>Telegram: this one is sticky. I like almost nothing about it, but at least one social community is centered here and it provides a gravity.</li>
<li>Discord: the worst. I cannot imagine the creature that looks at Discord’s UI/UX and thinks, “yes, good.” But at least one other social community is centered here. Worse, it’s one of the main discoverability engines for other communities important to me.</li>
<li>SMS: the barren wasteland of spam messages, family, professional services, and MFA codes from services that won’t let me use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time-based_one-time_password">TOTP</a> as the lord God™ intended.</li>
</ul>
<p>Oh yeah, also there’s email (feel free to <a href="https://letterbird.co/contrariwise">say hi!</a>)</p>
<p>If I’m on my computer looking to Be Social™ that means I need to have three, maybe four, maybe <strong>five</strong> different apps open.</p>
<p>Gentle reader, I don’t have that much attention to spare on a <em>good day</em>. Which means, in practice, Signal is open most of the time and I check in on the others a few times a week. And that sort of works, except that as anyone who knows me on Discord or Telegram knows, it’s like being friends with a ghost.</p>
<p>Occasionally I show up to rattle the chains and make your clocks run backwards, but mostly I’m quiet.</p>
<p>Except, wait, that kind of sounds like&hellip; Isn’t that basically what I was describing as the Golden Age of Instant Messengers™?</p>
<h3 id="the-revolution-of-rising-expectationshttpsthezvisubstackcompthe-revolution-of-rising-expectations"><a href="https://thezvi.substack.com/p/the-revolution-of-rising-expectations">The Revolution of Rising Expectations</a></h3>
<p>Yes. Yes it is. Except for one key difference. Unlike AIM or MSN or YIM or ICQ, on Telegram and Discord people can message you <em>while you are offline.</em> Uncouth! Heathens! Anathema!</p>
<p>Being offline on old-school Instant Messengers was Normal and Expected and when you opened one it was a Fresh Palette™ of Opportunity™.</p>
<p>Being offline on Telegram or Discord doesn’t stop the messages from arriving. Which means there’s a Weight™. A Burden™™. Opening either app is inviting yourself to a dinner where the meal is already in progress and may in fact be Half Digested™.</p>
<p>Collectively we’ve created this cultural expectation that everyone will always be available. Nobody is ever permitted to fully disconnect, and to attempt to do so is to abdicate participation in the Zeitgeist™.</p>
<h3 id="okay-old-man-but-what-can-we-do-about-it">Okay Old Man But What Can We Do About It?</h3>
<p>We can make a MUD about it.</p>
<h3 id="wait-didnt-you-say-you-werent-going-to-do-that">Wait, Didn’t You Say You Weren’t Going To Do That?</h3>
<p>I did. And I’m not. But I thought about it.</p>
<p>As many people know, I learned to program by hacking on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-user_dungeon">MUDs</a>. Circle. Diku. They’re the pasture to which my soul yearns ever to return.</p>
<p>Here’s my ridiculous idea. I would build a MUD. A place I actually want to inhabit online. I would make it available to any and all, those friends who could be convinced to give it a try. I’d make a web interface, so that it was as easy to use as possible.</p>
<p>And key, I would build a series of connectors from the MUD’s mail system to the other places where friends live.</p>
<p>On Telegram? Send a message to a bot.<br>
On Discord? Send a message to a bot.<br>
On IRC? Send a message to a bot.</p>
<p>Gentle reader we could build it better. Stronger. We have the technology.</p>
<p>Except every minute I spend working on this ridiculous project is time not spent on other, more Ridiculouser™ projects. Some of which are deeply important to me and my planned future.</p>
<p>So I think this idea needs to be allowed to wither on the vine.  Right idea(?), wrong time. Probably. Maybe. We’ll see.</p>
<h3 id="so-thats-it-then-youre-just-going-to-leave-it-like-that">So That’s It Then? You’re Just Going To Leave It Like That?</h3>
<p>For now? Probably. Yes. But this is a space where my mind tends to return and wander. I’ve also considered setting up an IRC server with many of the same goals in mind. I just don’t think I could convince most of my friends to use it.</p>
<p>But IRC is clearly undergoing a small resurgence thanks to modern easy-to-host servers and reliable web-based clients. I’ve seen more than two communities spring up in the last few months centered on a small ecosystem of self-hosted social media, IRC, and / or forums.</p>
<p>The counterculture is rediscovering the internet we mistakenly left behind and finding it Good™. I think eventually I’ll figure something out that works here. And with any luck I’ll convince my friends to make the Jump™.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>With apologies to <a href="https://rknight.me/blog/just-2025-things/">Robb Knight</a>, from whomst I stole the format.</p>
<h3 id="general">General</h3>
<p>Continuing and, indeed, accelerating the trend of the previous year, 2025 was marked by a significant amount of travel. Short trips, long trips. At times it felt like I was gone more than I was home, although the statistics don’t bear that out.</p>
<p>My blog is read almost exclusively by the friends who I directly link to it (thank you!) although it looks like <a href="https://thewizardly.com/2025/10/03/one-sentence-on-each-place/">one sentence on each place in Europe that I’ve been</a> broke containment, for an extremely small definition of “broke containment.”</p>
<h3 id="writing">Writing</h3>
<p>Speaking of my blog, I wrote a total of 55 posts on The Wizardly, and 7 on The Game Mage, which is more than I would have guessed before I looked. Yes, I’m counting quote-posts and unhinged one-liners. Knowing me is accepting the risk that at some point I might try to convince you that moths are butterflies of the night and that consciousness is a soup.</p>
<p>Also, and I mean this quite literally. Everything is a sandwich.</p>
<h3 id="travel">Travel</h3>
<p>I took 9 trips complex enough to warrant tracking in Tripsy, which implies usually at least a hotel room was involved. Three were for work, two were to Disney World, one each to PAX Unplugged and Europe. This was the first year in a decade where PAX West happened and I wasn’t there, which I had big feelings about at the time, but change is good and life moves on.</p>
<p>It’s interesting to me that I only tracked 9 trips, because I think I would have estimated more. It felt like I was always traveling, though I suspect a lot of that can be accounted for by weekend trips within driving distance. I went to a lot of estate sales, which doesn’t feel like it should count, but does eat up an entire Saturday with my propensity for turning it into an excuse to visit several other stores on my way.</p>
<h3 id="media">Media</h3>
<h4 id="tv">TV</h4>
<p>Top of mind because the series finale was less than a week ago, Stranger Things takes my top spot for the year. <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/theyre-good-dogs-brent">It’s a good show, Bront</a>. If you’re at all nostalgic for the 80s, and haven’t seen it, you should.</p>
<p>The only other shows I remember watching this year were Severance, Silo, and Good Eats. Technically my fiancé and I have also been watching That 70s Show at dinner, but at roughly one or two episodes a week it’s taken all year and we’re still not through.</p>
<p>I’ve instituted a new policy of not watching any episodes of a show until the show has completed its finale with good reviews.
This is a complicated way of having an excuse to not watch anything, because I’m not a TV person, but I’ve found over the years that if I tell people “I don’t like watching TV” they look at me like I’ve just insulted their grandmother’s gravy recipe, but if I say “I have a complicated and somewhat unreasonable rule for what TV I can watch that basically results in not watching any TV” they smile and nod and say something vaguely like “that’s interesting.”</p>
<p>I think because it reads more like I’m a weirdo and not like I’m making a value judgment about the amount of TV they (presumably) watch.</p>
<h4 id="movies">Movies</h4>
<p>Pretty sure I only saw two movies in the theater last year, which is two more than my goal of zero. Companion, and The Matrix in Extended Reality.</p>
<p>Companion was fine. The Matrix I probably should have done a blog post about, because it was pretty cool.</p>
<p>It took me many years to realize that the reason I don’t like going to the movie theater is that the movies are, almost to a fault, too loud, and I do not like going loud places.</p>
<p>Sometimes people will try to make the case for the movie theater as an experience that a person might enjoy, and what that tells me is that we are very different people. I can think of almost nothing I would enjoy less.</p>
<h4 id="games">Games</h4>
<p>I’m still playing World of Warcraft weekly on Wednesdays with my old guild master, even though we’re not even the same faction anymore. Years of improvements to WoW’s cross-faction play mean that I can be Horde and he can be Alliance and it almost never matters, which is a huge improvement. Say what you will about lore, an MMO lives or dies by my ability to have fun with my friends.</p>
<p>WoW aside, the only other game I put a significant amount of time into was Dune Awakening, which I <a href="https://thegamemage.com/2025/07/08/waking-up-to-dune-awakening/">posted about</a> over on <a href="https://thegamemage.com/2025/07/28/dune-even-more-dune/">The Game Mage</a>. 150 hours, and I still don’t think I recommend it.</p>
<p>My lack of progress on video games came down to Dune Awakening sucking up a vast number of available hours, and getting real serious about how I spend my leisure time in ways that look a lot less like leisure. I shipped more projects than I ever have before in my life, thanks in large part to AI automating the boring parts. Which necessitated getting way more serious about intentional leisure heading into the new year.</p>
<h4 id="music">Music</h4>
<p>According to Apple Music my top artists of 2025 were:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Weeknd</li>
<li>The Dear Hunter</li>
<li>Marianas Trench</li>
<li>Daft Punk</li>
<li>Ferry Corsten</li>
<li>Coheed and Cambria</li>
<li>Above &amp; Beyond</li>
<li>Christopher Tin</li>
<li>New Kids on the Block</li>
<li>Taylor Swift</li>
</ul>
<p>Over the next two years my goal is to be completely off all streaming services, and Apple Music is the last bastion. I’ve started collecting physical CDs again, originally planning to listen to them in that format, but I’ve come to realize that being able to cast them to various devices is too useful. So over the last few weeks I’ve used a spare iMac to rip all my physical media to FLAC.</p>
<p>It’s been fun digging through the music bins at Half Price Books, and I recently ordered the Stranger Things soundtracks from <a href="https://www.bullmoose.com/">Bull Moose</a> with the intention of making some period-appropriate MiniDiscs to listen to when I travel.</p>
<h4 id="books">Books</h4>
<p>For all that I don’t watch TV or movies, I do still manage to get quite a bit read. Not as many books as some people I know, more than many others, and countless blogs, essays, and papers that I don’t track in any way that would generate statistics.</p>
<p>I try to keep my <a href="https://thewizardly.com/bookshelf/">bookshelf</a>  as accurate and up to date as I can, limited only by books that aren’t in the database that I’m too lazy to add.</p>
<p>The broad trend of my reading for the year can be described as two very different themes.</p>
<ul>
<li>Theme #1 &ndash; <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Bunny-Omega-Run-Shifter-Popstar-ebook/dp/B07PVF8YKV">Trashy omegaverse shifter smut</a>.</li>
<li>Theme #2 &ndash; <a href="https://www.abebooks.com/book-search/title/filing-records-management/">Mid-century office worker praxis</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>If that doesn’t fully describe my tastes I don’t know what would.</p>
<h3 id="projects">Projects</h3>
<p>The first third of the year was given over to <a href="https://wizardhq.org/">WizardHQ</a>, a project that took up significant time but mostly didn’t work out. I’ve started drafting a postmortem about that, but the TL;DR is that I eventually realized it would need a level of time investment that I couldn’t provide while also continuing on with other projects, so I’ve let it quietly fade. I still stand by everything I was trying to do there, and I think it was a good idea. But it needs a continual investment of energy that I don’t think I can provide.</p>
<p>The second third of the year was given over to LimeTools, an experiment in letting Claude Code build a SaaS, which I used to run Line Entertainment stuff at PAX Unplugged. It worked amazingly well! And Claude Code has only gotten more capable since I built it. I’m not entirely sure what the next step for this project is. Even under ideal circumstances it’s never going to pay for itself. I have other ideas for things to try as a Line Entertainer. But it’s cool, so I might keep it around for another year and see what happens.</p>
<p>The third third of the year was half me traveling so much that I didn’t do any projects, and half starting to lay the foundation for next year’s projects. I’ve been learning Godot, something I probably should be talking more about over on <a href="https://thegamemage.com">The Game Mage</a>. I completed simple clones of both Flappy Bird and Angry Birds as part of a Udemy training course on 2D game design, and hope to finish the overall course in the first third of 2026.</p>
<h3 id="miscellanea">Miscellanea</h3>
<ul>
<li>I started to crochet again, especially on meetings where I need to focus and keep my hands busy. My goal is to complete one (1) gift-worthy blanket in 2026.</li>
<li>I’ve gotten out of Lorcana. It was cool, and I enjoyed my time with it, but it became the dominant consumer of my dedicated hobby time to the exclusion of all else, and is probably the main reason I didn’t hit any of my Warhammer goals.</li>
<li>I’m not entirely out of MTG, but I’ve strictly curtailed it to the cultivation of a limited number of sets in a limited number of ways, and anticipate time spent on MTG driving towards zero by roughly the second third of 2026.</li>
</ul>

<p>Older than thought, its wisdom carved in my genes by a thousand and a thousand ancestors. It predates me, it will postdate me. It demands worship through cravings, through exhaustion, through pain.</p>
<p>To sate its dark hungers I must move, I must rest. I must feed, I must fast. It craves the stillness of clear water and green things from the earth.</p>
<p>I am high priest of a cult of one. The god calls to me through the crack of my bones, “thou shalt live forever, or die trying.”</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>During last year&rsquo;s Hobbit Meal (which, apparently, I didn&rsquo;t post about,) I ended up serving way too much bread. Don&rsquo;t get me wrong. I like bread. But by the third or fourth meal of the day, it was too much. This year I&rsquo;ve cut it down just to the biscuits in the biscuits + gravy, plus the stuffing which is technically bread but I think mostly doesn&rsquo;t count.</p>
<p>Without further ado, here&rsquo;s the plan.</p>
<h2 id="0700-breakfast">0700 Breakfast</h2>
<ul>
<li>Egg Muffins w/ bell pepper: make ahead. In fact, I need to go start these after dinner tonight.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="0900-second-breakfast">0900 Second Breakfast</h2>
<ul>
<li>Butter-garlic-thyme mushrooms.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="1100-elevenses">1100 Elevenses</h2>
<ul>
<li>Biscuits + gravy. Real sausage gravy made the hard way.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="1300-luncheon">1300 Luncheon</h2>
<ul>
<li>Charcuterie. The meats come from the better local grocery store, and the cheeses from Trader Joe&rsquo;s.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="1500-afternoon-tea">1500 Afternoon Tea</h2>
<ul>
<li>Deviled eggs. Maybe. My plan was to outsource this, but I forgot to confirm the place is even open tomorrow, and I don&rsquo;t know that I want to encourage businesses to be open on holidays. I might have enough eggs to take a crack at doing this myself, but good deviled eggs aren&rsquo;t a recipe I&rsquo;ve cracked yet.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="1800-dinner">1800 Dinner</h2>
<ul>
<li>Sous vide turkey breast medallions.</li>
<li>Cornbread stuffing.</li>
<li>Crispy roasted potatoes.</li>
<li>Salad or something probably. A leaf.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="2100-supper">2100 Supper</h2>
<ul>
<li>Dessert.</li>
<li>Leftovers.</li>
</ul>
<p>It&rsquo;s a lot of food, but believe it or not, it&rsquo;s less than last year. I learned real quick that I needed to scale back how much I made of everything because even though my eyes often outpace my stomach, seven &ldquo;small&rdquo; meals is still a lot of food.</p>
<p>Eventually I&rsquo;d like to throw open the doors to Hobbit Meal as something of a &ldquo;friendsgiving,&rdquo; but none of my friends who live near me are looking for a place to go on Thanksgiving, which is probably for the best all things considered.</p>

			 <p>If I had to guess I last played <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en">Magic: The Gathering</a> in 2005. I went to a card shop (a type of place I spent approximately no time, even then,) to hang out with a friend who was hopelessly addicted to the stuff, and played a pickup game with one of the local card sharks. It went poorly, and I swore off the habit for good.</p>
<p>Except every once in a while it manages to get its claws back into me. Like a belligerent crab with a gambling addiction. “Just another pack,” it burbles in crabspeak.</p>
<p>Last year <a href="https://scryfall.com/sets/dsk">Duskmourn</a> came out with my heart squarely in its targeting reticule. Analog horror where the house is also a moth? Say less, sis.</p>
<p>The only problem? I knew I wouldn’t actually get back into playing. Look; maybe some people can pretend like they’ve got infinite time. I have the strictly opposite problem. I am, if anything, too aware of how little time I have. It’s not possible to do everything I want to do in a day, and every additional thing has to be at the expense of something else I’ve already decided is a priority.</p>
<p>But that’s okay. Lots of people buy books they’ll never read, movies they’ll never watch. Buying games you’ll never play is most of Steam’s business model. What if I just <strong>collected</strong> some Magic cards? As a treat?</p>
<p>This is basically, more or less, how I got into collecting set binders. Not for every set, but just for the ones that were both obtainable and thematically interesting to me. I decided not to go back and try to collect stuff that was no longer in print, because that’s a potentially infinite fractal and also risks getting quite expensive.</p>
<p>A smarter person would have done this by just buying singles. It’s by far the cheapest way to go about it. Being the contrarian I am, I decided to go the route of mostly buying packs. Why? Honestly, because they’re kind of fun to open. I’m largely immune to the siren call of gambling. The casino holds no power over me. But cracking a fresh pack of trading card product? That’s a high like no other.</p>
<p>One of the biggest reasons cracking packs isn’t the cost-effective way to collect a set is that you end up with a ton of duplicates. Depending on how many boosters I buy, it’s not impossible to get 10 or 20 of some cards, where I arguably only need one for the binder.</p>
<p>What to do with the rest?</p>
<p>Originally, I’d take all of my extra cards and try to trade them in for credit, then use that credit to fill in gaps where I hadn’t lucked into a card. This&hellip; Works? But you lose a lot of value in the process. If a card is worth $10 on resale it might be worth $0.50 in trade. Sure, I probably could try to sell them myself, but what hobby am I giving up to do that? Exactly.</p>
<p>I sold all my valuable extras for Duskmourn, but never repeated the process for <a href="https://scryfall.com/sets/eoe?as=grid&amp;order=set">Edge of Eternities</a>. I’ve got a huge card box filled to the brim with cards that I mostly don’t need, because I don’t actually play the game. What to do?</p>
<p>The last piece fell into place recently in the form of a medium-popularity (but growing) format for Magic: <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/news/feature/building-your-first-cube-2016-05-19">cube</a>.</p>
<p>The extremely TL;DR of cube is this: pretend that the only cards that exist are one person’s curated best-of list. That’s it. That’s the gimmick.</p>
<p>Cube is mostly presented as a draft format. Some friends get together and open “booster packs” from that curated setlist and build decks on the fly then play each other. I’m not really a fan of draft, but I can see the appeal. Also you get the fun of opening packs for cards you already own, which is definitely something I can get behind.</p>
<p>So I started thinking, what if I built a cube out of each of the sets I’ve decided to collect? That way, in some hypothetical future, if I ever do have the time to play, I can play a version of Magic that’s effectively “pinned” to the release of the sets I find most thematically interesting. I definitely wasn’t playing Magic when Duskmourn came out, but that’s an experience I can recreate at any time thanks to cube.</p>
<p>That became last weekend’s project. We culled my entire remaining Duskmourn collection into basically two categories. I have the collection binder, which has one of every card that came out. It’s basically an art book of Magic cards, and it’s a lot of fun to flip through. Then, I’ve got a box filled with actual playable cards, according to the basic rubric of 1 for each rare, two for each uncommon, and four for each common.</p>
<p>Later this year I plan to pick up some support products designed to hold reconstructed “booster packs” for the cube format so that I can properly store the Duskmourn cube, and this weekend I’m planning to go through the same process for Edge of Eternities.</p>
<p>All of the rest of my cards were donated to my fiancé, who operates a card shop and can sell them as inventory.</p>
<p>Now I’ve got the best of both worlds. I have my collection binder, and I have a frozen-in-time cube that would let me play the game, as it existed at the time, if I ever find the time to do it.</p>

<p>— <a href="https://ideopunk.com/blog/tipsforabetterlife">Conor Barnes</a></p>
<h3 id="in-the-beginning-god-created-a-budget">In the beginning God created a budget</h3>
<p>There’s basically two parts to a budget. There’s the part where you track things, and the part where you use it to make decisions. I’m decent at the first part. Awful at the second.</p>
<p>I’ve been using <a href="https://www.ynab.com/">YNAB</a> since it was desktop software. It does an incredible job of tracking how I spend my money and assigning it to categories. Categories that I have, nominally, assigned my income to. What it can’t do is tell me to stop spending money when I’ve overspent a category. Which is fair, because I can’t tell me to do that either.</p>
<p>Broadly, in practice, I spend my money on vibes. I know roughly how much I can get away with spending, and I’ve got systems in place to cover when I overspend, so I’m never at any real risk of the bills not getting paid, but it’s not a great way to achieve my longer-term goals.</p>
<h3 id="now-the-budget-was-formless-and-empty">Now the budget was formless and empty</h3>
<p>I’m old enough to have worked jobs where my paychecks were actual checks, delivered to the building, by hand, that I had to take to a bank to deposit.</p>
<p>Dinosaurs and Margaret Thatcher roamed the earth. Mosquitos the size of Volkswagens. Etc.</p>
<p>But for at least the last decade or so I’ve worked for companies with direct deposit, and where there’s direct deposit there’s usually a way to split that deposit between multiple accounts. I’ve used that ability to functionally “hide” money from myself.  Probably a solid third of my paycheck skips my checking account each month, diverted to various savings and investment accounts.</p>
<p>This is the mechanism that supports my tendency to overspend. While I know there’s always money in the rhetorical banana stand, I don’t always know how much and I don’t think of it as “available to spend.” A few times a year, I end up raiding one or more of those other accounts to cover. And that’s broadly what I think of as “the system working.”</p>
<p>As a consequence, I’ve never missed rent. Literally or rhetorically.</p>
<h3 id="and-god-said-let-there-be-income">And God said “let there be income”</h3>
<p>It turns out I’m actually pretty good at living within the limits of what I <em>think</em> I have. I know how much money is in my checking account at any given time, and that creates a rubric for what size of purchase I can make without needing to check the balance. Mostly it’s fine. Sometimes I overshoot, but then I’ve got savings to cover.</p>
<p>I call this the “zone of indiscriminate spending.” How much money can you spend without needing to think about it? Maybe it’s a couple bucks. If you’re fortunate, maybe it’s a couple hundred.</p>
<p>Right now this zone is much larger than I’d like it to be. I’d like to be operating like $10 is no big deal, but $100 requires scrutiny. In practice I operate at about one order of magnitude above that.</p>
<h3 id="and-god-said-let-there-be-spending">And God said “let there be spending”</h3>
<p>So I’m going to start living on minimum wage. Sort of. Kind of. Not really?</p>
<p>I’m going to put myself on an allowance roughly equivalent to minimum wage.</p>
<p>It’s a more extreme version of the technique that’s always worked: hiding money from myself.</p>
<p>The key here is to reduce my intuitive sense of what’s available to spend without actually putting myself in danger of bills not getting paid.</p>
<p>I call this a “load-bearing lie.” We all know it’s not true. I know it’s not true. But maintaining the fiction is important to achieving my desired outcome: I need to behave in all ways as if the money is not available to spend in order not to spend it.</p>
<h3 id="and-god-said-let-me-separate-the-good-spending-from-the-bad">And God said “let me separate the good spending from the bad”</h3>
<p>How do I do this in practice? Too many bank accounts.</p>
<p>My income from any and all sources will flow into a clearinghouse account, implemented as a money market account at my main bank. Their money market accounts have the same APR as a high-yield savings account, so money sitting in that account earns as much interest as money I’ve sent to savings.</p>
<p>However, money market accounts have withdrawal limits, so the next step is routing “spendable” money out of the clearinghouse in as few transactions as possible. Each of the following will happen on the last day of the month, to set up the next month’s spending.</p>
<ul>
<li>Transaction 1: my allowance to my personal spending account.</li>
<li>Transaction 2: my contribution to the family’s fixed expenses to our shared spending account.</li>
<li>Transaction 3: payment of any reimbursable work expenses to a dedicated credit card.</li>
<li>Transaction 4: transfer to savings.</li>
<li>Transaction 5: transfer to brokerage.</li>
</ul>
<p>Notably, this is exactly half of the “allowed” number of money market transactions in a month. That gives me breathing room to transfer again if something goes wrong. The whole point of this system is to automate as much as possible and avoid the need to do so, but I have the flexibility if I need it.</p>
<h3 id="and-god-said-okay-maybe-dont-spend-that-much">And God said “okay maybe don’t spend that much”</h3>
<p>Okay, so what is my allowance? I thought about this for quite a while and decided to pin it somewhat arbitrarily to Maine’s minimum wage.</p>
<p>Why Maine? Because I’m planning to move there in the next few years. Why minimum wage? Because it’s a psychologically useful framing. People find a way to make minimum wage work.</p>
<p>The problem I’ve set for myself is actually much easier than truly living on minimum wage, since the family’s fixed expenses don’t need to come out of that pool of money, but thinking of myself as trying to live at or below the minimum wage line provides a point of reference and an identity designed to guide me away from overconsumption and overspending.</p>
<h3 id="and-god-said-let-the-bills-be-with-the-bills">And God said “let the Bills be with the Bills”</h3>
<p>As you’ve probably already noticed, the devil is in the details. When I talk about not needing to pay for the family’s fixed expenses from this pool of money, that potentially leaves a lot of room to keep spending money the way I always have, except now with more steps.</p>
<p>What counts as fixed? What counts as discretionary?</p>
<p>In practice, it comes down to how the thing is paid.</p>
<p>I run almost all of my finances through credit cards, paying them off in full each month, and harvesting those sweet rewards points to help defer the costs of travel. Because I can’t have my credit cards pay their balance in full split from multiple checking accounts, each card effectively becomes a boundary.</p>
<p>Bills like the mortgage, insurance, card payment, and utilities don’t generally accept credit cards for payment. They autopay through ACH transfers.</p>
<p>All of the ACH transfers will go through the family account. All of the credit cards will get paid through my personal account.</p>
<p>If I swipe a card, it’s discretionary. If it autopays, it’s fixed.</p>
<h3 id="god-saw-all-that-he-had-made-and-it-was-very-good">God saw all that he had made, and it was very good</h3>
<p>I’ve spent a lot of words on what I’m planning to do, but not what I’m trying to achieve by doing it. I think because that part’s clear to me but somewhat harder to capture in words.</p>
<p>One reason is to fight back against lifestyle inflation. It’s so easy to spend money that I have on things that do not, ultimately, serve my long-term goals. And, once spent, it’s frequently hard to unspend. Sometimes in ways that accrue over time, such as additional subscriptions.</p>
<p>Another reason is to avoid developing sophistication that diminishes my enjoyment. If we “can’t afford” the fancier soap, are we really any worse off? What about those nicer bed sheets? That name-brand food product?</p>
<p>Eventually I’d like to reintroduce a significant gap between what I earn and my lifestyle, such that if my material circumstances changed I would not be worse off. This feels like, amongst many other things, good future-proofing.</p>
<p>At the end of the day $2500 per month is actually quite a lot for pure discretionary spending. People I respect immensely fit their entire life into that or not much more. It feels like a realistic and worthwhile goal, even as I acknowledge the ways in which I’m on “easy mode” in comparison.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Some of the concepts and terminology I’m about to use, as well as the title of the blog post, were lifted directly <a href="https://readwise.io/reader/shared/01k0vqat9xa9bj89xg4jmy1766">from here.</a></p>
<p>Having said that, I think I’m going to end up at a very different final destination than the original poster. So, credit where credit is due, but don’t feel compelled to read the original to understand my point.</p>
<h3 id="king-power">King Power</h3>
<p>King Power is money. I think the original article would try to lump in other things, like status, but one of my foundational operational primitives is that all of those things are fungible with money.</p>
<p>It’s technically possible in some communities to have status without having money, but those communities do not themselves have status in the wider culture. You’re welcome to feel about that all kinds of ways, and we may even agree, but it’s not germane to my point.</p>
<p>King Power is your ability to exert your will <em>on other people,</em> to achieve an outcome. This is most likely because you can pay them to do the task. (Originally, I was going to use another example here, such as being CEO, but that’s basically just paying them to do the task. See what I mean about it being fungible with money?)</p>
<p>Modern, industrialized, Western society teaches us that King Power is Good. You are virtuous and should be rewarded for seeking it. Gather money. Gather power. Become the CEO. Start a company. Own the local car wash.</p>
<p>What is best in life?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To crush your enemies, see them driven before you, and to hear the lamentation of their women!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>— Conan the Barbarian (1982)</p>
<h3 id="wizard-power">Wizard Power</h3>
<p>In contrast, Wizard Power is your ability to exert your will <em>on the world.</em> All those things the King is paying for? That’s other people exerting their Wizard Power.</p>
<p>Fixing your own car? Wizard Power.
Sewing your own clothes? Wizard Power.
Growing your own food? Wizard Power.</p>
<p>When a king exerts King Power, they’re constrained to the world of options that have been made available for purchase. They can have anything on the menu. We are told that this is good.</p>
<p>When a wizard exerts Wizard Power, they’re constrained to the world of <em>what’s possible.</em> They can have anything which could be <strong>put</strong> on the menu. That we are not told this is good is a lie perpetrated against us by those with King Power.</p>
<h3 id="why">Why?</h3>
<p>Because the more effort and energy you spend on acquiring King Power, the less effort and energy you spend on acquiring Wizard Power. Each person has only so much energy, so much time, and though you can do anything, you cannot do everything.</p>
<h3 id="is-this-a-manifesto">Is This a Manifesto?</h3>
<p>I mean. Inasmuch as basically everything I write is sort of a manifesto. What is a manifesto if not a dark essay?</p>
<p>Let’s call it a primer. It’s going to make a lot of future things make a lot more sense if I can refer to King Power and Wizard Power without having to define the terms.</p>
<p>I suspect you know where I’m going with this, and you’re very likely right, but the devil is infamously in the details.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>⁠⁠I have removed his place, his seat, and his tomb.</p>
<p>I have destroyed his soul, his spirit, his body, his shade, his magic, his seed, his egg, his bones, and his hair.⁠⁠</p>

			 <p>Lately I’ve been trying a new system for how I manage my evenings. Someone else might try “no system” or “having fun” or “relaxing,” but I am not that someone.</p>
<p>Instead, I’ve cobbled together something from the charred husk of the <a href="https://www.morgen.so/blog-posts/bento-method">Bento Method</a> that seems to work pretty well for me.</p>
<p>Of course, to make that make sense, I have to describe what came before.</p>
<p>In the early days there was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/StumbleUpon">StumbleUpon</a>, and it wasted a lot of time, and I got nothing done for approximately 2008-2016. Very little of that is StumbleUpon’s fault. I just wanted to mention StumbleUpon for some OG time wasting cred.</p>
<p>By the early 2010s I was using the then-nascent Bullet Journal method. By the late 2010s I was using GTD.</p>
<p>Over the last half year I’ve been using time blocking, which has gone through several iterations. Originally rough time estimates became fixed time blocks, deep focus to light focus. The problem with that level of fixed schedule was that frequently the real world happened, and things slipped, and I had no good way to get them back on track.</p>
<p>Once the train missed the station it was hard to go back.</p>
<p>I was looking at the Bento Method and I thought, “well, this seems interesting.” Not really looking to buy a new app though. I’m actually quite happy with OmniFocus. But the idea of setting tasks that sort of roughly align with how I was time blocking, but that would remain to be re-scheduled if I missed them was pretty compelling. And seemed to solve for my main pain point with what I was doing previously.</p>
<p>The other problem I set out to solve, related but unrelated, was bringing more focus to a single project at a time. I tend to have too many hobbies and interests, and in turn tend not to get very many projects to a proper “finished” state.</p>
<p>So I married the bento method up with two week sprints. I actually like sprints. I know, crazy, right? But I like the idea of bringing a limited amount of laser-sharp focus to a problem. And, I was able to bake in a little bit of a reward. After my two weeks? A week off!</p>
<p>I’m now halfway through my second week of my first sprint under this system, and it’s been great. I’ve gotten a satisfying amount of work done on a single project. Naively I thought one sprint would be enough to finish it, but of course bringing my attention to bear meant I found all kinds of new things it could be extended to do.</p>
<p>C’est la vie. At least I have next week’s “break” to look forward to.</p>

			 <p>I’m not a traditionally “goal-motivated” person. For certain values of goal, motivated, and person. I have a formative memory of telling my third grade teacher that I would not be setting any new years resolutions because the idea is quite ridiculous, thank you.</p>
<p>I continue to agree with past-me about that.</p>
<p>“Goals” are sort of like a report card: some people are super motivated by getting good grades for some reason. If this is you, stop it. Grades are a scam. Do as little as you can to pass, and spend as much of your time as possible being curious about the world around you. Go outside. Lick a bug. Everything worth doing is as far from a classroom as you are allowed to get.</p>
<p>I digress.</p>
<p>Nothing about having a goal helps you achieve a goal. The goal doesn’t define the process that leads to the goal’s success. The goal doesn’t punish you for failure. The goal is Gary Busey standing over your bed breathing <em>slightly</em> too loud while you sleep. Unsettling, perhaps, but it’s not kicking your ass and telling you to achieve your destiny.</p>
<p>You’re defined by what you do, not by what you say you’ll do. Set a goal to have beautiful teeth in a decade and then stop brushing your teeth. Clearly the operative lever here, the essential fulcrum, is the tooth brushing habit.</p>
<p>Best case scenario, you’ve set out to do something you were already going to do, and you did it. Most likely case scenario you failed to achieve the goal, were a failure, should pour salt on yourself, shrivel up, and die.</p>
<p>Yes, I am a perfectionist, why do you ask?</p>
<p>I can’t speak to how anyone else conceives of goals. I suspect not like I do. Given the above, can you blame me for not finding them motivating? A “goal,” as described, is an opportunity to demonstrate my limitless capacity to fail at my own ambitions. Why would I even start down that path?</p>
<p>Except, apparently, I have always set what a normal, rational person would call goals. If you’ve known me long enough you’ve probably heard me say I want to be the CEO of the company. Quite possibly with an almost <strong>feverish level of intensity</strong>.</p>
<p>Listen, I know I’m not going to be the CEO. I mean maybe <em>a CEO</em>. Eventually. But not at my current day job.</p>
<p>This is what I call a <em>Wildly Unachievable Goal</em>. The point isn’t to ever do the thing. It’s to pick a direction, burn the boats, set out across the American Southwest, and see how close I get. Because every step of the way is valuable. I’ll learn, I’ll grow. I’ll end up closer to it than I ever might have imagined.</p>
<p>I think that for a WUG to work, you have to take it at face value. You have to believe in it with your heart and spleen. If at any point you acknowledge that it’s not really your intention, the magic breaks. It’s the productivity equivalent of  a placebo.</p>
<p>Something new I’m trying out are Wildly Achievable Goals. WAGs. This is, I think, much closer to what a normal person would call a “goal.” It’s a thing I want to do, or have, or be, that through a reasonable series of steps, could happen.</p>
<p>A WAG might be “write a book.” It might be “launch an app on the App Store.” They’re things that normal human people do, but maybe you’ve never done.</p>
<p>The point of a WAG is that at the end of it, you have the thing you set out to do. No matter how audacious it is, you have reason to believe you could do it. No matter how long it takes, you think you could get it done.</p>
<p>A WUG is something you know you’ll never do, but you’re going to run full-chested at it anyway, because the point isn’t to get there, it’s to land among the stars.</p>
<p>WAG and WUG. Pass it on.</p>

			 <p>Somewhere around five years ago I briefly entertained the idea that I was very seriously going to attempt to be an author. During that time I approached this the way I approach everything: with my whole entire ass.</p>
<p><em>Why half-ass anything when you can whole-ass one thing?</em></p>
<p>Which meant that, among other things, I read a lot of books on how to do writing good. Also, I tried to practice doing writing good.</p>
<p>The following are two bits of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flash_fiction">flash fiction</a> that I wrote for practice.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="long-night-of-the-soul">Long Night of the Soul</h2>
<p>Kazrin felt the thrum of his dirigible&rsquo;s turbines through the wheel as he strained to guide his ship against strong chronomantic headwinds. Three days out from port, four more to the capital city, and nowhere to stop in between.</p>
<p>A symphony of lights erupted from the console in front of him. &ldquo;Not again.&rdquo; The thrum got weaker as the ship listed helplessly further to the port side. He slapped a heavy gloved hand against the wall while bellowing some of his juiciest curses. For a brief moment the turbine rumbled back to life, but quickly died taking the rest of the engines with it.</p>
<p>More choice words as the pilot flailed behind his seat looking for something, anything. He grasped at the jungle of cables full of various fluids and gasses. One of the tubes moved as he knew it shouldn&rsquo;t. Kazrin grasped, wriggled, and finally slammed it back into place. The turbines roared back to life.</p>
<p>Only four more days to go. A warm meal. A warm bed. There&rsquo;d be plenty of time once his work was done. For now, he was satisfied to be heading in the right direction.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="the-underthing">The Underthing</h2>
<p>Cold aethermantic resin dripped from the tunnel ceiling on to Alex&rsquo;s head as he traced his finger over the brass pipe schematic. Ruined parts were strewn around him, not a single one had fit. &ldquo;Lazy horking engineers never updating documentation,&rdquo; he cursed out loud. &ldquo;Kim valve&rdquo; the useless flow-chart indicated, &ldquo;model 703.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Alex pressed his last 703 into the indicated ports, connections snapping into place with a satisfying click. Several pressure dials started to rise in an encouraging manner indicating positive resin flow. A great gout of fluid burst through the middle of the device, gauges falling back to their zero readings and covered him in even more of the viscous goo. Great, now he was out of Kim valves and he smelled like a cheeseburger went dancing on a hot summer day.</p>
<p>He pulled out the ruptured 703 and tossed it on the growing pile, then examined his parts bag critically. No more 703s, but a rusty Alice 417 and a Stanley 286. Out of better options to try he jammed the 417 into one side and the 286 in the other, then pressed the two parts together. They didn&rsquo;t quite fit, but a few wraps of luminescent green fibertape and maybe? Almost? The pressure gauges ticked up and the tape held.</p>
<p>The sound of resin flowing was music to Alex&rsquo;s ears. Fifteen years in the tunnels and it never stopped sounding sweet. He gathered up his tools and set off, there would be many more leaks to fix before the day was done.</p>

<p>“What a week, huh?”</p>

<p>Without exception, the smartest people I know are all in agreement that Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) is on the way in the next three years. That could mean a lot of things. Good things. Bad things. I think it’s reasonable to assume nobody can predict what the world will look like beyond that horizon.</p>
<p>Kurzweil’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Singularity_Is_Near">Singularity</a> is finally near.</p>
<p>Let me be clear: the Singularity is the moment beyond which we cannot imagine the future, because it is entirely different from the world we have always known. Dear gentle reader, I think that point is not more than a year or two from now.</p>
<p>But I’m not here to talk about AI or AGI or the Singularity, because that’s one way in which I think people are right to be worried. There’s the part where technocratic oligarchs have bought what remains of the American government, citizens are being deported to Guantanamo Bay, and airplanes are <a href="https://apnews.com/article/philadelphia-plane-crash-medical-transport-8617dab53471190832dd73db149489fa">falling</a> out <a href="https://apnews.com/live/dc-plane-crash-reagan-updates">of the sky</a>.</p>
<p>The bad news keeps rolling in, and I think it’s reasonable to expect that it gets worse from here.</p>
<p>There will never come a point where the red tribe will wake up and realize “oh no, this isn’t what I voted for.” This <em>is</em> what they voted for.</p>
<p>I know you desperately yearn for a “leopards ate my face” style realization of the atrocities they’ve caused. Will continue to cause. Are actively rejoicing in causing. That is not coming, and I need you to stop investing energy in waiting for it. There is work to be done.</p>
<p>If you’ll permit me a crumb of silliness in this tryin’ time, I’d like to present a framework that may help you figure out how you can help when everything feels hopeless, when it feels like the world is crumbling.</p>
<p>Please select from one of the following four class options:</p>
<p><strong>Blanche</strong>: Charming, debonair, slutty. First in line to shank a bitch out back the Waffle House at 3 AM if they even glance at one of her homies.</p>
<p><strong>Sophia</strong>: Wise, sardonic, unstoppable. A force of nature in the Greek God sort of way. Could correct Peter Jackson on what it sounds like when you stab someone in the lung.</p>
<p><strong>Dorothy</strong>: Intelligent, charismatic, truth to power. Plans on plans on plans. Why do physical violence when emotional violence works as good at half the price?</p>
<p><strong>Rose</strong>: St Olaf Stories as a finesse weapon. Emotional support  friend. Can a cheesecake be a familiar? Have some cheesecake. I SAID HAVE SOME CHEESECAKE.</p>
<p>Look. I know it’s hard. But you need to figure out what you can do to help. Even if that’s taking care of yourself today so that you’re here to fight tomorrow.</p>
<p>It’s deeply unfair that we are called upon to fight this battle. Nevertheless, you are called. Nevertheless, you must fight.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, you must persist.</p>

<hr>
<p>I believe it was roughly around this time of the year, several hundred years ago, third or fourth grade to be imprecise, that I declared in no uncertain terms that new years resolutions were stupid, and I would not be doing them.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve met me, that anecdote probably doesn&rsquo;t seem very surprising. Yes, I was always like this. No, I won&rsquo;t elaborate.</p>
<p>The reason I bring it up is that I&rsquo;m about to talk about what to many people would in fact sound like a new year&rsquo;s resolution, but is prompted approximately zero percent by the new year and entirely by the trip to Disney World staring me down from approximately two weeks in the future which I am clearly, woefully, physically unprepared for. No doubt I&rsquo;ll still have an amazing time, but I can tell before I even catch my flight that some things are going to need to change.</p>
<p>Currently I weigh somewhere between &ldquo;can walk up a flight of stairs without stopping&rdquo; and &ldquo;sir you won&rsquo;t be able to ride this ride today.&rdquo; I don&rsquo;t always need a seat belt extender when I fly, but sometimes I do. I&rsquo;ve weighed more, I&rsquo;ve weighed less, but as I get older it&rsquo;s becoming more of an issue in more ways, and something clearly has to be done. As a close friend once said, &ldquo;you can be old, or you can be fat.&rdquo; He was speaking from a position of authority and wisdom.</p>
<p>Like most fat people, I&rsquo;ve already tried everything. Everything. Whatever you&rsquo;re thinking, I&rsquo;ve tried it. From &ldquo;eat less, move more&rdquo; to Keto, to GLP-1 agonists. Some things worked for a while, then stopped working. Some things never worked. Nothing worked indefinitely. The things that worked the best required persistent, ongoing, considerable discipline. I suspect any system that will succeed for me will have that feature, and the challenge will be convincing everyone to arrange my life around it. You can only get away with being so weird if you want to succeed by normal definitions of success, and I&rsquo;m not Steve Jobs enough for abnormal definitions of success.</p>
<p>So this post is somewhat of a manifesto. It is, in part, an attempt to document the things I am going to attempt to start doing because I think they&rsquo;ll help. It is also, in part, to justify the weirdness I will need to introduce into my life and the lives of others to improve my likelihood of success. It is, if nothing else, an attempt to be legible.</p>
<h2 id="part-1---food">Part 1 - Food</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;The real importance of the ‘never’ list is that you have to make a commitment that there are some things in your life that you’re going to give up and you’re never going to have again. And there’s not a diet that I know of that ever said, ‘You know what? You’re going to say goodbye to some things forever.’ I actually think that’s important because it’s a symbolic life change that says ‘I’m turning a corner.’ It’s a statement of ‘I’m making a permanent change.’ That’s important from both a psychological and nutritional standpoint.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em>- Alton Brown</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In 2010&rsquo;s &ldquo;Live and Let Diet&rdquo; Alton Brown, host and creator of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_Eats">Good Eats</a>, introduced what he called the &ldquo;System of Four Lists&rdquo; &ndash; effectively, a contract with himself that helped Brown build and maintain a 50lb weight loss. Each list was designed to either encourage good food choices, or discourage bad ones.</p>
<p>The first list was comprised of things he decided he must eat every day:</p>
<ul>
<li>Leafy greens</li>
<li>Nuts</li>
<li>Carrots</li>
<li>Green tea</li>
<li>Whole grains</li>
<li>Fruits</li>
</ul>
<p>As I understand it, the purpose of focusing on things he must have rather than things he couldn&rsquo;t have, was to flood the playing field with good food. To leave less room for things that didn&rsquo;t support his desired health outcomes. Instead of focusing on restriction as the primary goal, to focus on nutrition to the exclusion of problematic foods.</p>
<p>The second list are things he needed to eat at least three times a week:</p>
<ul>
<li>Yogurt</li>
<li>Broccoli / Cauliflower</li>
<li>Sweet potato</li>
<li>Avocado</li>
<li>Oily fish</li>
<li>Tofu</li>
</ul>
<p>Restriction enters the picture in his third list, the things he can only have once a week. Effectively, the treats:</p>
<ul>
<li>Red meat</li>
<li>White starch</li>
<li>Desserts</li>
<li>Alcohol</li>
</ul>
<p>In the original version of Live and Let Diet that aired, white starch was &ldquo;pasta,&rdquo; but in articles published later online it appears that he broadened it. My guess is by white starch what he really means is everything I think of as &ldquo;sugar.&rdquo; I have a notoriously broad definition of sugar, which extends pretty much all the way to all purpose flour. Any refined carbohydrate. So all breads are sugar, but a baked potato is not. Maybe he intended to include baked potatoes in his white starch category, I don&rsquo;t know. I think my problem probably isn&rsquo;t the number of baked potatoes I eat.</p>
<p>Finally, the &ldquo;never&rdquo; list. The things he had to give up for good:</p>
<ul>
<li>Soda</li>
<li>Processed meals</li>
<li>Canned soups</li>
<li>&ldquo;Diet&rdquo; anything</li>
<li>Fast food</li>
</ul>
<p>That seems clearly and objectively correct to me. There goes my chances of getting a Taco <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell-shaped_function">Icosahedron</a> sponsorship, but I think that&rsquo;s probably a risk I&rsquo;m willing to take.</p>
<p>Let me say that I really like this approach. I like the idea of filling up on healthy &ldquo;must haves&rdquo; to edge out less healthy alternatives. I like the idea of allowing a little fun as a once a week treat. I even like the idea of saying &ldquo;never&rdquo; to the things we all know are bad. There&rsquo;s power in never. Never reduces the option space, it removes an entire class of negotiation from the table. &ldquo;No&rdquo; is the most powerful word in the English language, and a complete sentence.</p>
<p>My smart move is probably to take this, exactly as written, and try it for a month before I make any adjustments. And I think that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m going to aim to do. Just for the sake of completeness though, here are the adjustments I&rsquo;m considering:</p>
<ul>
<li>Carrots are fine, but I&rsquo;m not a huge fan and I just can&rsquo;t think of how I&rsquo;d manage to fit them in every day without getting sick of them.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;m not a huge tea drinker, green or otherwise, but I&rsquo;m game to try. I don&rsquo;t like hot beverages, but I think tea might be my best opportunity for replacing soda.</li>
</ul>
<p>That&rsquo;s it. Those are the changes I think I&rsquo;d want to make. But, let&rsquo;s give it an honest try first.</p>
<p>&hellip; After I get back from Disney. Because it&rsquo;s only a couple weeks away, because the food at Disney is part of the appeal, and because it provides a break point to clear out my kitchen and refresh anew.</p>
<h2 id="part-2---activity">Part 2 - Activity</h2>
<p>In October&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.relay.fm/cortex/148">State of the Apps</a> CGP Grey talked about <a href="https://www.whoop.com/us/en/">Whoop</a> and the extent to which the data it provided was a &ldquo;game changer&rdquo; for his health journey. I bought one immediately. Well. Rented. Their business model is to give you the device on pain of subscription. I&rsquo;ve been wearing it for over a month now, and its data collection is pretty impressive.</p>
<p>With a month of basically &ldquo;normal&rdquo; baseline data, it has a good sense of how healthy I am (or am not,) and suggests some reasonable goals:</p>
<ul>
<li>More steps</li>
<li>Better sleep</li>
<li>Exercise a couple times a week</li>
<li>Avoid added sugar</li>
<li>Drink water</li>
</ul>
<p>Which, really, seems like very milquetoast advice. What&rsquo;s important is that it can mostly track those automatically, and suggest realistic goals based on how I&rsquo;m actually doing. Next week, for example, I&rsquo;m going to aim for 6600+ steps per day, a sleep consistency of 70%+, any exercise at least two days, no added sugar at least five days, and meeting my hydration goal at least five days. Then at the end of the week I&rsquo;ll review, adjust as necessary, and try again. Unlike the food plan, this starts immediately. Although I can&rsquo;t promise I&rsquo;ll avoid added sugar at Disney. Because Dole Whip.</p>
<p>All of these systems, together, I&rsquo;m calling my Health Operating System. Like any other OS, I&rsquo;m sure they&rsquo;ll need patching and updates from time to time, but I&rsquo;m broadcasting it wide so that everyone who has to deal with me knows what&rsquo;s what. These are the things I&rsquo;m choosing to prioritize, and the rules I&rsquo;m willing to be inconvenient to maintain. Apologies in advance.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Every December my partner and I make the drive down to the Warhammer Citadel in Grapevine, TX to play our end-of-year game. If you&rsquo;re a fan of Warhammer but have never been to the Citadel, imagine a Games Workshop or Warhammer store that&rsquo;s also a coffee shop. It&rsquo;s the closest thing we have in North America to <a href="https://warhammerworld.warhammer-community.com/explore-warhammer-world/">Warhammer World</a>, but it&rsquo;s closer to a normal Warhammer store than that statement might imply.</p>
<p>Still, as the North American headquarters for Games Workshop, it has the benefit of being fully stocked with even the rare and unusual games, lots of well-painted minis on display, and probably 20 open tables in the back. It&rsquo;s worth a trip if you&rsquo;re in town, but not a trip to town if that makes sense. But I digress.</p>
<p>At the start of 2024 we determined to play a full 2000 point game, my <a href="https://warhammer40k.fandom.com/wiki/Tyranids">Tyranids</a> vs his <a href="https://warhammer40k.fandom.com/wiki/Death_Guard">Death Guard</a>. Then my year exploded. Suddenly it was September and I didn&rsquo;t have a single painted model to show for it. What I did have, however, was almost all the <a href="https://warhammer40k.fandom.com/wiki/Necrons">Necrons</a> I&rsquo;d need for a Boarding Action. So we pivoted, and rather than try to rush 100+ unpainted models, I finished the roughly ~11 for our new goal.</p>
<p>The Necrons had been a previous year&rsquo;s army of the year, so I have a decent set of them in various states of completion, and we were big fans of Boarding Actions which came out around the transition from 9th to 10th edition Warhammer, so this was a delightful return to form.</p>
<p>So, how did it go?</p>
<h3 id="before-the-battle">Before the Battle</h3>
<p>In the current edition of Warhammer you determine who goes first by rolling a six-sided die (d6,) and whoever rolls higher goes first. That person also picks who is the &ldquo;attacker&rdquo; and who is the &ldquo;defender.&rdquo; The attacker and defender have different deployment zones, places where they can put their minis on the table at the start of the game, and the defender has to put their minis down first. It&rsquo;s useful to be able to go second in the deployment phase, because where your opponent puts their minis tells you something about their strategy and can allow you to make last-minute strategic decisions about how to respond.</p>
<p>I won the roll-off, which meant that I would get to go first, and I chose to be the attacker, which meant that I got to deploy second.</p>
<p>We each held one unit in reserve to be deployed through strategic shenanigans later. He had a unit of <a href="https://www.warhammer.com/en-US/shop/Death-Guard-Poxwalkers-2021">Poxwalkers</a> that he could deep strike (place anywhere on the table that was at least 9&quot; away from one of my models,) through the usage of a limited resource called Command Points. I had a unit of <a href="https://www.warhammer.com/en-US/shop/Ophydian-Destroyers-2020">Ophydian Destroyers</a> that have deep strike as a natural ability.</p>
<p>A few more units were held in reserve to come in through the normal deployment mechanism, because Boarding Actions allows a limited number of units to be in the deployment zones each round.</p>
<h3 id="round-1">Round 1</h3>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>During my turn I advanced my unit of <a href="https://www.warhammer.com/en-US/shop/Necrons-Flayed-Ones-2021">Flayed Ones</a>, one unit of <a href="https://www.warhammer.com/en-US/shop/Necron-Warriors-2020">Warriors</a> and my <a href="https://www.warhammer.com/en-US/shop/necrons-royal-warden-2023">Royal Warden</a> towards the central objective. The Royal Warden was my Warlord, which I think is sort of an unusual choice. He&rsquo;s basically a slightly more powerful Warrior, and in the regular 40K rules he gives an attached unit of Warriors the ability to run away and shoot in the same turn. In Boarding Actions he shouldn&rsquo;t be able to do that, but as a house rule we decided that he could because it&rsquo;s flavorful, and we think in the spirit of what the rules intended.</p>
<p>In the Northwest corner I moved my unit of <a href="https://warhammer40k.fandom.com/wiki/Canoptek_Scarab">Scarabs</a> to claim the objective. We wouldn&rsquo;t figure out until round three that they had no objective control score, which meant they couldn&rsquo;t actually claim that objective for me. One of my lessons learned!</p>
<p>Finally, I moved my unit of <a href="https://www.warhammer.com/en-US/shop/Necron-Triarch-Praetorians-2020">Triarch Praetorians</a> to capture the objective in the Southwest corner.</p>
<p>On his turn Ash moved his unit of <a href="https://www.warhammer.com/en-US/shop/Chaos-Spawn-2016">Chaos Spawn</a> to claim the Northeast objective, then advanced his Poxwalkers and <a href="https://www.warhammer.com/en-US/shop/Death-Guard-Typhus-2020">Typhus</a> to open a hatchway into the southern corridor. This was his first major tactical mistake, as he forgot entirely to attempt to claim the Southeastern objective this round.</p>
<p>He repeated that strategy in the north with another unit of Poxwalkers and his <a href="https://www.warhammer.com/en-US/shop/Death-Guard-Scribbus-Wretch-2020">Tallyman</a>.</p>
<h3 id="round-2">Round 2</h3>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Seeing that Ash intended to make use of Hatchways to get into the Northern and Southern hallways, I redirected units in both of those directions. To the North I ran my Flayed Ones into his unit of Poxwalkers. It was an immediate and decisive victory for the Flayed Ones, who eradicated the entire unit in one combat while taking no wounds.</p>
<p>I deployed a unit of <a href="https://www.warhammer.com/en-US/shop/Necron-Lychguard-2020">Lychguard</a> to the South to block another unit of Poxwalkers who were attempting to head for the Southwest objective. This was strategically one of Ash&rsquo;s better trades. The Lychguard have a relatively small number of incredibly strong attacks. Overall they were probably the strongest units either of us had brought, and in a perfect world I would have run them directly into his warlord, Typhus. Because their attacks were so strong, any Poxwalker they hit was guaranteed to melt, but because they had so few attacks they could only take out a few each round.</p>
<p>Seeing his Chaos Spawn coming for the central objective, I deployed my Ophydian Destroyers via Deep Strike directly on to the central objective to both claim and protect it. It was clear to me that my relatively slow moving warriors weren&rsquo;t going to get there in time, and if he claimed it I&rsquo;d have trouble shifting him off.</p>
<p>During Ash&rsquo;s turn he ran the Chaos Spawn directly into my Ophydians, dealing two wounds which wasn&rsquo;t quite enough to take one down. In the trade, my Ophydians did six wounds back, fully 3/4 of the damage his unit could sustain, and removing one of the two Chaos Spawn models.</p>
<p>Using the stratagem &ldquo;The Dead Rise&rdquo; allowed him to deep strike his final unit of Poxwalkers into the far Northwest corner, aiming them for my poor solitary unit of Scarabs. However, they were unable to move on their first turn on the board.</p>
<p>A unit of cultists in each of the Northeast and Southeast corners claim both objectives for him, and spend the next term &ldquo;securing&rdquo; the objectives, which would allow them to remain under his control as the units continued to move away. I forgot this was something units could do, and that specifically only my Warriors could do it. I had built my list assuming I&rsquo;d need to keep a unit on each objective I wanted to hold, which is why the Scarabs continued to sit in the Northwest corner. Since part of his strategy was to try to claim one of my back field objectives, this was probably the right idea regardless.</p>
<h3 id="round-3">Round 3</h3>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>In the Southwest I advance one of my units of Warriors towards the objective, freeing up my Praetorians to advance to the center of the board. I knew that Typhus was headed that direction, and that they had a decent melee profile, so I wanted all of my best bruisers ready to hold the contest for the central objective.</p>
<p>To the North I had my Flayed Ones open the hatchway towards the Northwest objective, positioning them to rescue my Scarabs on the following turn.</p>
<p>On Ash&rsquo;s turn he managed to start making progress against a few of my units. One of his cultists got a lucky shot in the shooting phase and did the one wound needed to finish off one of my Ophydians. Poxwalkers continued to trade with my Lychguard in the south, taking one of them out as well. I also lost a Scarab to his risen Poxwalkers in the Northeast.</p>
<p>He sent Typhus directly into my unit of Warriors, hoping to take them out in a single round. Unfortunately, he only managed to kill two.</p>
<h3 id="round-4">Round 4</h3>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>If you&rsquo;re not familiar with the Necrons, they&rsquo;re basically ancient space-faring robotic Egyptians. Basically. And they have a couple interesting gimmicks, but probably the one they&rsquo;re most well-known for is the ability to reanimate in the middle of combat. So sometimes you think you&rsquo;ve killed them, and then they stand right back up, stick their thumb to their nose, and blow a raspberry. And by blow a raspberry I mean they shoot you dead with plasma weapons.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s what I did.</p>
<p>Now would be a good time to thank the dice, who were exceptionally kind to me this day. More than half of the models that Ash had managed to kill stood back up, including both the Ophydian and Lychguard from the previous round. This was not a good outcome for him. It was a great outcome for me.</p>
<p>In my movement phase I carefully arranged as many units as possible to be able to shoot at Typhus. The mission we were playing scored an extra 10 victory points for murdering the enemy Warlord. I got close to putting a wound on him a couple of times, and then my own Warlord, the Royal Warden actually managed to hit with six wounds. Exactly enough to kill Typhus. Both of Ash&rsquo;s saving throws failed, which should have killed Typhus, but he burned what remained of his precious command points to roll again and saved on the second attempt.</p>
<p>What the Royal Warden couldn&rsquo;t do, the Ophydian Destroyers certainly could, and in the fighting phase they marched right in and turned Typhus into a fine plague-flavored sashimi.</p>
<p>In the Northwest, my Flayed Ones came to the rescue of my Scarabs, and eradicated the Poxwalkers that were harassing them.</p>
<p>At this point, with almost all of his Poxwalkers defeated, his Warlord dead, and me in control of more than half the board with strong units he would be unlikely to defeat, Ash conceded.</p>
<p>I won 55 to 30.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<h3 id="my-learnings">My Learnings</h3>
<ul>
<li>Scarabs can’t claim objectives. They probably would have been most useful running ahead and opening a door for me. I have a bad habit of forgetting that the hatchways in Boarding Actions can open.</li>
<li>Lychguard are strong bruisers, but without many attacks do their best work against a single beefy target. I really wanted to get them stuck in against Typhus, but Ash did the right thing gumming them up with Poxwalkers.</li>
<li>Praetors didn’t get much of a chance to shine, and looking at their profile now I would probably be smart to trade them out for something with a more clearly defined role in the battle.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="ashs-learnings">Ash&rsquo;s Learnings</h3>
<ul>
<li>He intended to use the cultists to “sticky things and then die,” and the Poxwalkers were meant to gum me up. In practice, the cultists mostly never arrived to the battle. Probably they should have come out first and ranged ahead, so that the Poxwalkers would have had an easier time getting into position.</li>
<li>Typhus needs to be used more tactically, he’s not invincible. It came as a surprise when I killed him basically twice.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="final-thoughts">Final Thoughts</h3>
<p>This was the only game of Warhammer we played in 2024, which is a real shame. We both love it. It&rsquo;s arguably part of how we met. I like the structure of having a game at the end of the year to work towards, because if nothing else we know that one game will happen.</p>
<p>Next year we&rsquo;re focusing on Necromunda as our game of choice, which has much smaller armies (called gangs) than even Boarding Actions. I hope that by having a smaller painting commitment we&rsquo;ll be able to get into games sooner in the year, and our annual game next December will be the capstone of a campaign rather than the only game we play.</p>
<p>In closing, here is every one of his models my Necrons managed to take off the board. The real gift was the Poxwalkers we murdered along the way.</p>

			 <p>The society I happen to have been born into is based on consumption. It tells me that my worth is measured in my economic contributions. That I will be judged by the clothes I wear, the car I drive, the establishments I frequent.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had enough. Generally. Broadly. And also, in some cases, specifically. In just about every way it makes sense to measure, I&rsquo;ve had enough.</p>
<p>I reject the premise. I rebuke thee. I cast thee out.</p>
<h1 id="the-year-of-enough">The Year of Enough</h1>
<p>So begins the Year of Enough, my next yearly theme. The astute may have noticed that it&rsquo;s technically still 2024, and that&rsquo;s true, but immaterial. Yearly themes need not align perfectly to arbitrary notions of time. What&rsquo;s important is that they are useful to the person undertaking them. Consider it another way I abjectly refuse to adhere to the role society would like me to play. This year, my year starts on December 1, 2024.</p>
<p>Anything worth starting is worth starting <strong>now</strong>. Not tomorrow. Not next year. Now. As the poet Yoda once said, &ldquo;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3-CpzZJl8w">do, or do not.</a>&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mechanically what does &ldquo;Year of Enough&rdquo; mean? At its core, it means no unplanned spending. Of money. Of time. Of effort. Of energy. I have enough. Enough material goods. Enough things to do. Enough recommendations. Enough.</p>
<p>The best yearly themes are conceptually simple, but deep. Enough lands right in that sweet spot. It applies to almost every category I could mention. Whatever it is I almost certainly have enough of it. In many cases I have too much. It works as a response to every exhortation. Enough.</p>
<p>What does this look like in practice? In many ways like a &ldquo;buy nothing&rdquo; year, with some notable exceptions. Travel and time spent with friends remain important to me, and I&rsquo;ll continue to prioritize those. I&rsquo;m not cancelling any of my planned trips. Some of those trips are to new and novel places, and may require me to buy some things to be appropriately prepared, and any necessary purchases along those lines are pre-approved.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s also some furniture for the house that I will need as the remodel completes, and that list has been specifically defined. A new chair. Accessories for an existing chair. The needfuls to complete the lounge, the hobby room, and the master bedroom.</p>
<p>Along those lines, replacing anything that breaks, home repairs, and consumables are all valid expenditures. I&rsquo;m not trying to live an ascetic life. Well. At least not yet. Maybe someday I&rsquo;ll go full-on recluse, but not today. &ldquo;Enough&rdquo; means no more of the things I&rsquo;m already sated on. It doesn&rsquo;t mean suffering through obvious deficiencies.</p>
<p>This means that, among other things, I am no longer accepting recommendations. For shows to watch, movies to see, music to listen to. One category already bursting at the seams of enough is &ldquo;things to do.&rdquo; I will try to return the favor as best I can. Nobody I know is really suffering a surfeit of free time, and it would be rude to inundate them with my own recommendations while politely declining theirs. Know that if you ask, I have them in ready supply, but you will need to ask. This is as much for your own benefit as it is mine.</p>
<p>Something I failed to do last year was define success.</p>
<p>At the end of the Year of Enough, I think success would look like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Every room in the house is clean, organized, and there are no unsorted &ldquo;piles&rdquo; of things in need of a place to live.</li>
<li>There is enough time in the day to do work I enjoy doing, to care for my meat chariot, and to pursue an interest or hobby.</li>
<li>Nothing I consider important is languishing. This might need its own blog post to properly develop, but the idea is that I should not be able to look around and find some interest or hobby that I haven&rsquo;t engaged with, that I shouldn&rsquo;t feel like I&rsquo;m not taking care of myself or others.</li>
</ul>
<p>There will never be enough time to do everything, but there should be enough time to do the important things.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The tactical result of an engagement forms the base for new strategic decisions because victory or defeat in a battle changes the situation to such a degree that no human acumen is able to see beyond the first battle.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No battle plan ever survives contact with the enemy.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>-Helmuth von Moltke the Elder</p>
<p>Nearing the end of the year, I&rsquo;m starting to think about next year&rsquo;s theme. But before I get into that, I think it&rsquo;s worth reviewing how <a href="https://thewizardly.com/2023/12/31/its-the-last.html">this year&rsquo;s theme</a> went.</p>
<p>TL;DR &ndash; poorly.</p>
<p>Looking back on how I defined my theme for the year, I think the idea was solid, but I lacked clarity on what exactly I meant to do differently. One big mistake is that, outside of the start of the year, I mostly never thought about it again. It didn&rsquo;t serve as a &ldquo;north star&rdquo; like so many yearly themes do. Whereas the Year of Time (2023,) kept popping up everywhere I looked, the Year of Scales of Arpeggios mostly just happened.</p>
<p>In the blog post linked above, I set out three specific plans I intended to engage in. If you haven&rsquo;t clicked through, they were:</p>
<ul>
<li>Wake up before work, use that time productively.</li>
<li>Build a system for meal planning.</li>
<li>Learn to play disc golf.</li>
</ul>
<p>And dear reader, I did approximately none of them.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not quite entirely fair, I actually did get really good at waking up earlier. But I don&rsquo;t really use the time productively. I think the end result is that I&rsquo;m more &ldquo;awake&rdquo; when work starts, and that has some positive benefits, but never not once did I ever get my treadmill time in before the day started. Planning the day continues to be an elusive challenge. Executing the plan even more so.</p>
<p>It feels hardly worth even mentioning the other two, beyond saying that I didn&rsquo;t even start to try. I forgot I meant to. The year got away from me and now here we are, on the precipice of December, and I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m planning to start any of that in the remaining four weeks.</p>
<p>We can&rsquo;t win them all, and I didn&rsquo;t win this one. On to bigger and better things!</p>

			 <p>You might surmise that this is a political post. And it sort of is, but also it isn&rsquo;t. Because winter has always been coming. And most likely, winter will always be coming. Winter might be Trump, it might be climate change, it might be an asteroid that strikes the Pacific ocean and obliterates all life as we know it. We don&rsquo;t know when winter will come, nor what form it will take, but winter is coming.</p>
<p>Some people will read that and assume that I am being defeatist. That clearly, we must all give up in the face of insurmountable odds. And no, read what I said because it doesn&rsquo;t include anything about giving up. Despite it all, I&rsquo;m not a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nihilism">nihilist</a>.</p>
<p>That winter is coming is an indisputable fact of our universe, and the answer to winter is to chop wood, preserve food, <a href="https://usdictionary.com/idioms/hunker-down/">hunker down</a>, and tell stories. Prepare for winter; to be able to weather it, because you do not control which way the wind will blow. You never did, and you never will. Winter can and will show up on its own schedule, in its own way, and there is nothing to be done about it except to prepare.</p>
<p>Our ancestors built communities by huddling together around the fire, and though the mode may have changed the method remains. Many hands make light work, and there remains much work to be done. There always will, because the universe does not owe us peace. The universe does not owe us anything. Winter is coming, and the only chance we have to stand against it is together.</p>
<p>With any luck, and no small amount of fortune, we will get to plant trees under whose shade we will never sit. It is not for us to rest, because winter is coming. But we might hope that others may some day wonder at what winter ever was.</p>

<p>Wargaming as a hobby is incredibly cloistered, a series of rituals performed by robed adherents, and the systems broadly share so many concepts that you often draft on one to learn another. This means that onboarding someone into our mystery is often an afterthought - the process starts by reading thirty some-odd pages of scripture, but the real questions you&rsquo;ll grapple with are the same as the fresh acolyte of any religion. They will all be within interactions the &ldquo;rules&rdquo; only suggest. It&rsquo;s not that the map isn&rsquo;t the territory - it&rsquo;s that the map generally describes a world which cannot possibly exist, and the work is in harmonizing that with the real world. This is a form of labor I delight in! But there might be hard limits on how many people want to collaboratively embroider a secular religion in their leisure time.</p>

		<a href="https://thewizardly.com/2024/10/25/on-generative-ai/" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2024-10-25 12:25:22 -0600">Oct 25, 2024</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I would describe myself as &ldquo;cautiously optimistic&rdquo; about generative AI. LLMs are clearly capable of doing some useful things. Anyone who tries to argue otherwise at this point probably sounds a lot like they&rsquo;re trying to argue the sky isn&rsquo;t blue or the moon isn&rsquo;t cheese.</p>
<p>For a little background, I first heard about GPT-2 back when it came out, a couple of years before ChatGPT hit the world stage, and some of the smartest nerds I know were marveling at the fact that you could get it to play chess competently. This was a surprising result, because LLMs use statistical techniques against words to predict outputs given an input. It shouldn&rsquo;t know what &ldquo;chess&rdquo; is, and it shouldn&rsquo;t be competent at the game.</p>
<p>Early ChatGPT didn&rsquo;t really impress me that much, and it routinely got stuff wrong. My best example of this would violate confidentiality, so consider that I&rsquo;m not necessarily trying to convince you that old ChatGPT sucked. I think that should be obvious. Mostly I&rsquo;m mentioning it to explain why I didn&rsquo;t even bother to start trying to use it or its competitors until much later.</p>
<p>Once Google announced Bard, I joined that bandwagon and made a few slight attempts to get it to do something useful. It mostly couldn&rsquo;t, which also shouldn&rsquo;t be surprising. An example of this was asking it to plan a Hawaiian vacation for me. I figured planning a vacation was the kind of thing that GenAI could probably handle, there should be lots of examples of vacations that people enjoyed. It really, really wanted me to go see the Pearl Harbor memorial. (I did not.)</p>
<p>Okay so that&rsquo;s all fine and good. Jump to today. I use ChatGPT at work, and Claude at home, and for my use cases, I think Claude is a lot better, but I wanted to talk a little bit about what I&rsquo;m actually using them for. What do I think they&rsquo;re good at?</p>
<p>ChatGPT has proven itself quite adept at taking my stream of consciousness and making something other people could understand from it. If I start typing out the details of an email I would like to send, the important points, the audience, the tone, it will generate an email that&rsquo;s perfectly cromulent. Same with a Slack message. But also same with a Jira ticket. If I know basically what needs to happen and the order it needs to happen in, then Jira saves me the trouble of spending time formatting it into a proper set of acceptance criteria.</p>
<p>Claude, with its Artifacts feature, has helped me develop and then fill out templates for data that I want to live inside my knowledge management system. I asked Claude for a template for a System of Systems document, and together we worked to refine it to have the detail level I wanted. Then I tossed it my list of systems, and it did a decent job of a first pass to fill it out.</p>
<p>The recurring theme is that I&rsquo;ve found GenAI saves me from <em>typing</em> but not from <em>thinking</em>. Best case scenario it will prompt me with some questions that I might not have considered, but the important connection-making and organizational work is still happening in my brain. Given that, even as an unstructured stream of consciousness, the LLM can then enforce an order and produce an output that might be useful for someone else trying to understand what I thought. I don&rsquo;t really expect this to change, and once the hype cycle properly dies down I think we&rsquo;ll discover it&rsquo;s roughly the limit of what an LLM can do. It&rsquo;ll get better at doing it, but it can&rsquo;t really have an &ldquo;original&rdquo; thought.</p>
<p>My question is how much money would you pay for the functionality I&rsquo;ve just described? Right now both ChatGPT and Claude have generous free tiers, but that&rsquo;s because their investors are expecting them to eat the world at some point, and, once eaten, for GenAI to have become so essential that people won&rsquo;t be able to remember how not to use it. They&rsquo;re building their captive audience today, and eventually that bill is going to come due.</p>
<p>I suspect the true cost of this service is a lot more than I&rsquo;d be willing to pay to avoid typing an email, but time will tell. Maybe we&rsquo;ll find a way to make &ldquo;good enough&rdquo; LLMs operate affordably. We&rsquo;re still in the &ldquo;a computer takes up an entire room and only universities have them&rdquo; phase of this technology, and right now I have five different computers on my desk all of which are more capable than a mainframe was in 1982.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m also concerned about the environmental impact, in the sense that we burn a truly fantastic amount of electricity to provide this service. But I think that&rsquo;s more general than LLMs. We spend a truly fantastic amount of electricity to do lots of things, and are generally incapable as a society of building real solutions to that problem.</p>
<p>Finally, I&rsquo;m concerned that OpenAI, Anthropic, and every other GenAI company out there had to basically steal all of the world&rsquo;s knowledge to build this thing. I mention this, because I think it&rsquo;s worth mentioning. Copyright infringement is apparently okay when Microsoft does it, but if the consumer pirates a copy of Windows now suddenly they care? I am not compelled by arguments about how hard it would be to solve this problem, nor how much it would cost. If we wanted to, we would. But I definitely think it&rsquo;s fair to consider this in your rubric for how seriously to respect the rights of corporations in turn.</p>
<p>For now I continue to stand by my policy of no GenAI content on this blog. It would defeat entirely the purpose. I&rsquo;m not trying to impress anyone. I&rsquo;m barely even trying to convince anyone. These are my thoughts, filtered through my own artistic sense of the right words to use to convey them. 90% of the value is that I took the time to express them, and 10% is whatever value other people might derive from consuming them. But it would be a tactical error to continue to avoid GenAI indefinitely. If you&rsquo;re not engaging with it currently I&rsquo;d strongly recommend thinking about where it might be able to help you; the answer is almost certainly not &ldquo;nowhere.&rdquo;</p>

			 <p>I have owned several iPads, and the role of the iPad in my life has changed over the years. With today&rsquo;s announcement of the new iPad mini, I think it&rsquo;s time to reevaluate which iPad(s) I need, and potentially start the trade-in process.</p>
<p><strong>Question #1</strong>: What do I actually use my iPad for today?</p>
<p>I have an iPad mini. I bought it around the time my kindle kicked the bucket, and my intention was to use it mainly as a reading device. In my mind I thought it&rsquo;d take it with me on appointments, but in practice I don&rsquo;t have many of those. It has come with me on every flight since I&rsquo;ve owned it, and it does a lot of heavy lifting as the main thing I do to keep myself busy while traveling. In that context, I mostly read blog posts through <a href="https://readwise.io/read">Readwise Reader</a>.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot to like about Reader, even though it&rsquo;s a beta product, but their offline reading experience falls a bit short: images aren&rsquo;t cached. That might not matter to some people, but ends up being pretty important in the kinds of blog posts I have a tendency to save for later reading.</p>
<p>Because it was intended to be a reading device, I got the 64GB version, which is not enough space to store movies or TV shows for offline watching. Sometimes, especially in hotel rooms, that&rsquo;d be a nice feature to have. I don&rsquo;t subscribe to any streaming services, so I need the files to be available on my iPad if I want to watch them.</p>
<p>Finally, it&rsquo;s a small use case, but the Citadel Colour app is only available on mobile, so despite the fact that I have an iMac on my painting desk, I need an iPad or similar for looking up paint recipes.</p>
<p><strong>Question #2</strong>: What do I think I might use my iPad for in the future?</p>
<p>Last weekend I purchased a <a href="https://us.kobobooks.com/products/kobo-sage">Kobo Sage</a> for eBooks. I really liked my Kindle, but I no longer shop with Amazon and do not intend to buy a new one. The iPad, it turns out, provides too many distractions and so I rarely read books on it. The Kobo probably won&rsquo;t arrive for at least another week, but once it does, I intend for it to live in my (not quite yet built) reading nook. It may not come on flights, I haven&rsquo;t decided.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s worth noting that the Kobo solves for a use case I intended the iPad to solve, but for which the iPad ended up being poorly suited: books. There&rsquo;s nothing wrong with the device, this is entirely a limitation of my attention. Given all the things an iPad can do, I get easily distracted and end up not reading long-form books. I think having a dedicated device that serves this role and has no distractions is key to getting myself to read more. It worked, in fits and spurts, with the Kindle. So the Kobo will do that now.</p>
<p>However, the Kobo doesn&rsquo;t solve for everything. It doesn&rsquo;t solve for &ldquo;read it later&rdquo; and it doesn&rsquo;t solve for graphics-heavy formatted PDFs, such as TTRPGs I back on Kickstarter.</p>
<p>Again, I&rsquo;m thinking out loud here so bear with me.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m starting to develop the following rubric:</p>
<ul>
<li>Text-focused books designed to be read for enjoyment, entertainment, or education will live on the Kobo.</li>
<li>Graphics-focused books will live on the iPad.</li>
</ul>
<p>To be clear, the iPad really does do these things equally well. It&rsquo;s more about the mental partitioning. I can&rsquo;t have one device that does both of these things because my squishy brain must be cajoled into doing things that I enjoy doing if the activation energy of doing them is greater than zero.</p>
<p><strong>Question #3</strong>: Which iPad?</p>
<p>The million dollar question. Or thousand dollar. Probably.</p>
<p>Really I think there&rsquo;s two contenders. The 13&quot; iPad Air and the new iPad Mini. For all intents and purposes they are functionally identical except for size.</p>
<p>I do like the size of the iPad Mini I have. It&rsquo;s easy to carry around. It moves around the house quite a lot. It&rsquo;s perfect for Reader, and acceptable for TV/Movies. I haven&rsquo;t tried referencing a TTRPG rulebook on it, and I will before I commit to a decision, but that&rsquo;s the one thing that I think the larger iPad is likely to excel at.</p>
<p>If, like me, you think &ldquo;well why not just keep the current iPad Mini&rdquo; then let me introduce one more variable. As I mentioned earlier, Readwise Reader doesn&rsquo;t work great in offline mode. So I&rsquo;m seriously considering getting the cellular-enabled model, which solves for lack of connectivity everywhere except airplanes, and which lets me solve another unrelated problem: kicking the tires on a new wireless provider in a way that doesn&rsquo;t require committing an existing device.</p>
<p>So now I&rsquo;m stuck in the worst possible place: compelling arguments between two options and no clear rubric to pick one or the other. The larger iPad seems like it&rsquo;d be better at looking at PDFs, the smaller iPad seems like it&rsquo;d be better for read-it-later blog articles. The smaller iPad is great for travel, and travel is the main thing I use my iPad for. The price difference between the two options doesn&rsquo;t really matter, but it&rsquo;s too expensive to get both and call it good.</p>
<p>What to do?</p>

			 <p><em>From the journals of St. Rev. Dr. McPunch, Dweller, Vault 76</em></p>
<p>&ldquo;Reclamation day&rdquo; my entire ass. The vault has everything we need, and I&rsquo;ve spent most of my life in it! Everyone else was in a hurry to get out and see the world. I&rsquo;ll tell you what you&rsquo;ll see: a fat lot of nothing. How could there be anything to see? Twenty years isn&rsquo;t nearly enough time to clear the rads. But I&rsquo;m running out of food, and I&rsquo;m going to have to go out there eventually. Might as well be on my terms.</p>
<hr>
<p>Of course once you go outside, the door closes behind you. Nothing to it but to do it I guess.</p>
<hr>
<p>Couple of girls standing near the vault entrance. &ldquo;A real dweller, gosh!&rdquo; I&rsquo;m as shocked as they were. There&rsquo;s still people out here? Guess there&rsquo;s some sort of rumor going &lsquo;round about treasure, and some people think it&rsquo;s the vault. Hate to break it to you, nothing in there. I bet it shut down the instant the last dweller (that&rsquo;s me, hi,) left. But there&rsquo;s people, and not just people from the vault. That&rsquo;s got to be something, right?</p>
<hr>
<p>Found the remnants of a farm not far down the hill, and a group of people calling themselves the Responders. They traded some basic supplies for a little help. I don&rsquo;t mind playing a bit of gopher for some chems and clean water. The bad news? I guess there&rsquo;s a cult? That worships the Mothman?! I ran some supplies for the Responders up the hill to another group calling themselves the Brotherhood. Bunch of tightwads, but caps is caps.</p>
<hr>
<p>Never thought I&rsquo;d see it, but someone left a Power Armor frame down at the farm. Just hanging out, free for the grabbing. It&rsquo;s been stripped for parts, so nothing more than a frame and a bit of juice to keep it moving. I wonder if I can find the missing parts?</p>
<hr>
<p>There was a call for help out of the South, something about a robot? I&rsquo;ll tell you, it was the most people I&rsquo;ve seen in one place since Reclamation Day. Mostly vault dwellers like myself, several with fully-functional sets of Power Armor. And me with my Little Slugger covered in razor blades. Oh well. I&rsquo;m not really sure that I was much help, but there was definitely a robot. Wearing a sheep? It was confusing. But I got some more caps and chems for my trouble.</p>
<hr>
<p>Overseer left a trail to follow, which has taken me to a little town called Flatwoods. Looks like it used to be a base of some kind for the Responders. I guess I&rsquo;m formally a Volunteer now? At least that&rsquo;s what the computer&rsquo;s saying. There&rsquo;s basically nobody left to confirm it, just one other random lady and her dog. Doesn&rsquo;t seem like she knows much about it either. I did some tests, cooked a burger, and stole anything not nailed down to the floor. It looks like they called everyone back to a place called Morgantown&rsquo;s airport. I&rsquo;ll have to go check that out at some point.</p>

			 <p>I might be the only person you know who doesn&rsquo;t shop on Amazon.</p>
<p>That’s not to say I never did. I had prime, many years ago. I even had a couple of those <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Dash">little IoT buttons</a> that could automatically order products inside a cabinet cupboard. I think I used one to order breath mints once.</p>
<p>Of all the things they have done and still do, there’s only one consumer level service from Amazon that I miss: my kindle.</p>
<p>Amazon got the experience of using the kindle extremely right. The page turn is fast and satisfying, the distractions are few, books load quickly. Except for the fact that Amazon makes it, it&rsquo;s the perfect device. So of course the baby must go out the window with the bathwater. It wouldn&rsquo;t be acceptable to say &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t shop on Amazon&hellip; Except for this one way in which I do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In case it&rsquo;s not abundantly clear, I take disproportionate amounts of psychic damage from small inconveniences. Maybe Steve Jobs and I <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2011/11/14/the-tweaker">would have gotten along</a>, because even the most trivial of ways in which a product can get something wrong will absolutely ruin it for me. Which is why I&rsquo;ve never quite found my stride using an iPad mini to replace my kindle. Oh it&rsquo;s a fine device. I&rsquo;d probably even recommend it. But I don&rsquo;t use it to read very many books, for about seventeen smallish reasons.</p>
<p>All of which is to say I think it might be time to reevaluate the eReader ecosystem.</p>
<p>By which I mean I already did that. Because there&rsquo;s really only a handful of players, the kindle is still dominant, and they all suck in one way or another.</p>
<p>But I think there&rsquo;s a path forward with <a href="https://us.kobobooks.com/collections/ereaders/products/kobo-libra-colour">Kobo</a>. It appears to have the best support for sideloaded books, and for a variety of reasons that&rsquo;s the way I need to be able to get my books on to a device. It also has the best support for getting my highlights back off through the stack of services I prefer using.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, they&rsquo;ve spent a lot of effort on their new pen ecosystem which looks cool but doesn&rsquo;t really seem to have a good export story. It doesn&rsquo;t help me to be able to &ldquo;draw&rdquo; on a digital book if that drawing is trapped forever on the kobo&rsquo;s screen. Sorry, Rakuten, this ain&rsquo;t that.</p>
<p>All other things being equal I&rsquo;d rather have a device that does one thing extremely well, and then carry as many such devices as needed. Almost nobody builds those devices anymore, there&rsquo;s no path to hockey stick unicorn trajectory golden parachute baked brie on rye simply being the best at solving a real problem these days. Also it needs AI. Sprinkle some AI on it. <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/bitches-love-smiley-faces">Bitches love AI</a>.</p>
<p>Which means, realistically, a device that&rsquo;s competent at the thing I care about, and then does a bunch of other stuff I don&rsquo;t. It&rsquo;s fine to have features I won&rsquo;t use, as long as they don&rsquo;t impact the experience. They usually do, because product managers literally can&rsquo;t help themselves. But we all fall far from the grace of dogs. I, too, have sinned. Etc.</p>
<p>Is this a long-winded way of saying that I&rsquo;m probably going to buy myself an eReader at some point this year? Probably. Will I still buy a new iPad mini if they announce them? Probably also yes. And carry both every time I catch a flight somewhere. But I think that&rsquo;s probably a worthy trade, in the hope that by specializing my use case for each they&rsquo;re marginally better at what I need them to do than the current mini is at half-doing both.</p>

			 <p>I spent most of last night talking with a dear friend about community and connection in the current age of the Internet.</p>
<p>We met, what feels like a hundred years ago, on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IRC">IRC</a>. I&rsquo;ve sat here, staring at that line, for several minutes, because I&rsquo;m not sure what I want to say about IRC. It was the perfect chat network for me, an environment where I thrived, and I miss it.</p>
<p>The astute may say something to the effect of &ldquo;but IRC&rsquo;s still there!&rdquo; Yeah. In the same way that Twitter&rsquo;s still there. Technically. If you have no respect for yourself. Technology has a way of clinging to a horrifying half-life long after the point where any reasonable person has left. IRC&rsquo;s still out there, but I think it&rsquo;s safe to say that it&rsquo;s inhabited almost exclusively by people who are pointedly refusing to accept that times change. Even though I, myself, think that the technologies that replaced it are generally worse, they&rsquo;re still where the people are, and the people are the part that matters.</p>
<p>Making new friends as an adult is hard, in part, because time is precious. I am very rarely in situations where connection happens automatically. Think of primary school. It&rsquo;s easy to make friends when you&rsquo;re young and in school because you&rsquo;re trapped in the same place with a group of people for long periods, going through the shared experience. Basically the only place that happens to an adult is work, and while it&rsquo;s possible to make friends at work it&rsquo;s not always the best place to do so. Depends an awful lot on where you work and what you do.</p>
<p>Social clubs once would have filled this niche, and probably still do for many. The elks, eagles, and most venerable moose are all different versions of an excuse for adults to hang out together. If you live somewhere with an active social club, my sense is that opportunity still exists. At least if TikTok is to be believed. TikTok would also like me to be very aware that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freemasonry">Freemasonry</a> exists. Thanks, TikTok. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jtU9BbReQk">ThikTok</a>.</p>
<p>One of the problems with a social club, assuming you could find one nearby, is that they frequently require you to be in a specific place at a specific time. I don&rsquo;t know about you, but all of my weeknight evenings are already spoken for, with a long list of things I wish I had time for already jostling to find a spare moment to infest my day. I would need to radically reorient my life to make an evening free to go spend it with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_Order_of_Odd_Fellows">IOOF</a>. Maybe that&rsquo;s still worth doing, at some point, but it&rsquo;s a hard sell!</p>
<p>The internet, at its best, enables a sort of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asynchronous_communication">asynchronicity</a> in communication. I can send you a message now, and you can reply to it later, and we can have a long, slow conversation that doesn&rsquo;t require either of us to be bound to a specific place or time. Email did this, before the spammers made it unsafe to share your email. Forums did it, back before Google trained us out of surfing the web. In theory this is great, because I can make it fit whatever my schedule happens to be, and does not require large contiguous blocks of time like a social club.</p>
<p>Being a part of the IndieWeb is a little subversive, in a way. It&rsquo;s staking a flag on the claim that the internet should be free. And a little bit weird. It&rsquo;s a thing that we all build together, separately, in our own way. And sometimes it&rsquo;s a little bit lonely. Being off the beaten path means fewer feet find their way to your digital garden. For better or worse. It&rsquo;s IRC, sort of, in the sense that we&rsquo;re all participating in the process of refusing to be part of the blessed path. It&rsquo;s also a community, if you want it to be. And there&rsquo;s connection, if you look for it. Certainly better than what&rsquo;s left of the festering corpse of Twitter.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not quite a social club, but it&rsquo;s a start.</p>

			 <p>A few months ago I looked back at my first 30 days of tracking 100% of my time. Now I have about a quarter&rsquo;s worth of data, and some patterns have emerged.</p>
<p>Looking at the data by project:</p>
<ul>
<li>Physiological Needs - 35%</li>
<li>Online Entertainment - 22%</li>
<li>Work - 19%</li>
<li>Hobbies - 12%</li>
<li>Other - 12%</li>
</ul>
<p>I think this is broadly in line with what I saw 30 days in. Physiological needs is mostly dominated by sleep, but includes some other &ldquo;maintenance of the human body&rdquo; type tasks that need to happen daily, and which slowly add up over time. The key takeaway for me is that, on average, the care and maintenance of my meat chariot is more than a third of my day. And that&rsquo;s not even particularly good care. That&rsquo;s darn near the bare minimum. It frustrates me how much time it takes to care for myself, and it&rsquo;s a number I wish that I could drive lower but know in my heart actually needs to be higher.</p>
<p>The other takeaway is that, at least in the quarter where I was measuring, I spent a <strong>lot</strong> more time on the various sub-categories of &ldquo;Online Entertainment&rdquo; (mostly video games,) than I would have otherwise estimated. I do enjoy video games, I just didn&rsquo;t think I spent that much time on them.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s possible to get a little bit deeper into where exactly that time went, when I look at the description I used to track it. In some cases the description always matches up with the category. Work is always work. In other cases, this is where it becomes possible to disentangle things.</p>
<ul>
<li>Sleep - 34%</li>
<li>Work - 19%</li>
<li>Computing - 7%</li>
<li>Travel - 7%</li>
<li>Fallout 76 - 6%</li>
<li>WoW - 4%</li>
<li>Cooking - 3%</li>
<li>Game - 3%</li>
<li>Good Eats - 3%</li>
<li>Errands - 2%</li>
</ul>
<p>I removed a couple of categories for personal reasons, so you may notice that doesn&rsquo;t quite add up to 100%. It is, however, the highlights.</p>
<p>Notice that sleep, at 34%, is only 1% shy of the entire physiological needs category. Travel only made it up to 7% because I booked an entire convention under the category. It seemed like the closest and most applicable way to track that time, but for convenience I tracked the whole event that way including time spent eating, sleeping, etc.</p>
<p>This leads me to two actionable conclusions.</p>
<ol>
<li>I probably spend a smidge more time gaming than I would ideally want to. As much as I enjoy this, it&rsquo;s the thing eating the most time from other hobbies.</li>
<li>All of my mental time budgets that assume I spend 1/3rd of my time &ldquo;sleeping&rdquo; fail to account for the rest of the time that it takes to maintain a human body.</li>
</ol>
<p>My next step, I think, is to retool the categories I&rsquo;m using to better reflect how I want to spend my day. &ldquo;Online entertainment&rdquo; lumps together too many things that I can only usefully split back out by the description on the time record.</p>
<p>Some of the categories I think it might be useful to track include:</p>
<ol>
<li>Multiplayer Games</li>
<li>Singleplayer Games</li>
<li>Content Creation</li>
<li>Content Consumption</li>
<li>Cooking (Hobby)</li>
<li>Cooking (Sustenance)</li>
</ol>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m getting a lot of actionable information out of tracking sleep, although it&rsquo;s useful for the habit of tracking everything else. Pretty sure there&rsquo;s a few other categories I never tracked that I&rsquo;m likely to trash entirely, but it&rsquo;s good to try the system recommended by others before you start making changes.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;d like to talk a bit about my favorite Massively Multiplayer Online PvP Game: <a href="https://www.ebay.com/">eBay</a></p>
<p>On the off chance you&rsquo;re not familiar, eBay is an auction platform. People post the trash they would like to sell, and other people post bids of how much they&rsquo;d be willing to pay for that trash.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s important to note, gentle reader, that it is always trash. Occasionally it is trash which happens to be quite valuable. It is nevertheless trash.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s okay, I&rsquo;m a purveyor of fine trash and trash accessories. This is my native habitat.</p>
<p>Within the eBay ecosystem it&rsquo;s somewhat customary to start an auction at $0.99, with the expectation that nothing actually sells for that much. It&rsquo;s either worthless and nobody bids, or it&rsquo;s quickly bid up to somewhere between what you could sell it for at a garage sale and what it&rsquo;s probably actually worth.</p>
<p>On the buyer side, eBay asks a relatively simple question. &ldquo;What is the most amount of dollarsmoney you would pay for this trash object?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I cannot stress this enough, dear reader. The answer to &ldquo;how many dollarydoos would you pay for this knicknack,&rdquo; there is only one acceptable answer. <em>Lies.</em></p>
<p>You see, under the hood eBay does something really quite clever. Let&rsquo;s say that a Trashthing is currently listed at a bid of $5. I perceive the Trashthing and decide that the most I would pay for it is $80. I would like to spend less than that, but I would be willing to go up to $80. If I were to tell this to eBay, magically eBay would manage bids for me. It would start with $6, which beats the person who had bid $5, and now the Trashthing is listed at $6. Assuming nobody else comes along, I will pay $6 and receive my Trashthing.</p>
<p>But let us say that someone else comes along and decides they would like to pay $20 for the Trashthing. They don&rsquo;t know that I&rsquo;ve already told eBay I&rsquo;m willing to pay $80, so they enter their $20 bid and like magic the price jumps to $21, and they&rsquo;re notified they&rsquo;ve lost. It is at this point, having already told eBay that they were willing to spend $20 and no more, that they walk away content in the knowledge that someone else was willing to pay more for the Trashthing than they were.</p>
<p><strong>Except no they don&rsquo;t.</strong> Do you know what they do? They extend their foul touchers to their mouse and their keyboard and they bid <em>again</em>. <em><strong>Again</strong></em>, dear reader. They put in a new maximum price of $30 or, if they are feeling particularly nasty, $35. And they lose again, because that&rsquo;s still less than my $80.</p>
<p>$45? No. Fine. They walk away, dejected. Except if they had just said $45 from the start, they could have avoided the hassle. The outcome for everyone is identical. They don&rsquo;t get the Trashthing because I&rsquo;m willing to pay more, I still pay $46, slightly more than the next closest bidder, and the seller receives the local maximum price for their Trashthing.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something deeply human about this process, because it happens every time. We renegotiate &ldquo;the most we&rsquo;d be willing to pay&rdquo; based on the amount other people have said they&rsquo;re willing to pay.</p>
<p>This is <em>asymmetric information warfare</em> at its most visceral. You do not know how much I value the thing, but you will find out repeatedly I value it more than you. And if I value it so highly, well, shouldn&rsquo;t you? And why shouldn&rsquo;t you have the Trashthing? It would look so very prim next to your collection of Whozits and Whatsits Galore. Thingamabobs? You&rsquo;ve got twenty. But who cares, no big deal. You want more.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s when things get meta. You know that I know this, but do I know that you know this? So what if, instead of the most I&rsquo;d be willing to pay, I put half? Then I can find out where the set point is. Maybe I&rsquo;m now the winner, maybe I&rsquo;m not. In either case I have new information. And if you come along and nickel-and-dime me out of the winning position, I have no incentive to fight you. All I&rsquo;ll do is drive the price up early. I have the signal I needed. At which point the winning strategy is always, always, to wait until as close to auction close as practical to swoop in with my true highest bid, in the hopes that you will be too busy in the real world to notice, and will have done something very similar, resulting in a &ldquo;maximum bid&rdquo; below your true bid.</p>
<p>Then, in approximately six hours, I discover if I&rsquo;ve won yet another MiniDisc player.</p>

			 <p>The way I make sense of the world is to talk about it, at length, with anyone who&rsquo;ll listen. Which frequently means the people closest to me are stuck listening to me as I work out any complicated long-poll decision making process.</p>
<p>A couple weeks ago I had an idea. The problem with a new idea is that if I do too much due diligence, I&rsquo;ll lose enthusiasm for it. Sometimes, I think, it&rsquo;s important to just carry forward and see what happens. On the flip side, sometimes I end up doing a bunch of work only to find out that the idea won&rsquo;t work out, for reasons that would have been obvious from the start if I had done some investigation.</p>
<p>This new idea lives somewhere in the uncomfortable middle. The reason I wanted to do it, it turns out, is no longer valid. But the idea itself has taken root in my mind with a life of its own.</p>
<p>You might notice I&rsquo;m being cagey. What is the idea? I can&rsquo;t say, because as soon as I explain what the idea was I&rsquo;ll lose enthusiasm for it. Being able to tell people about the thing I want to build removes all of the urgency around building it so that I can show them. So, I&rsquo;m sorry if it makes this post a bit harder or more frustrating to read.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ve got this idea to build a thing, and the reasons I originally wanted to build it are kaput. But maybe I should still build it anyway? That&rsquo;s the process I&rsquo;m currently working through (by which I mean my friends and family are suffering through.) Fortunately, I think I can distill it down into one big pro and one big con.</p>
<p><strong>PRO</strong> - I think this thing could be the chewy nougaty center around which an interesting community develops. The thing itself may not be viable for any of its original intended purposes, but I love building communities.</p>
<p><strong>CON</strong> - This will, like everything, suffer the opportunity cost of all the other things I&rsquo;m not doing instead. Of which there are many, because I have too many hobbies.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a core risk / reward decision to be made here. I could choose to spend that time doing many other things, some of which would be a lot more materially productive. But I will note, and it has been noted to me, that I have never been as visibly &ldquo;excited&rdquo; to be working on a project in the entire time my partner has known me. There&rsquo;s a certain magic about this kind of thing, and anything that brings the magic and vibrancy this idea has brought probably ought not to be ignored.</p>
<p>So, sorry for the vagueness. With luck, someday, I&rsquo;ll be able to talk more concretely about it. Either because it exists, or because I have decided it never will.</p>

			 <p>Establishing a baseline for reviewing things can be difficult.</p>
<p>Culturally, it seems like most Americans operate on a rating system that reflects the way that American schools grade. Start with a perfect score, then subtract points for failure.</p>
<p>No complaints about that book you got on Amazon? Five stars. Nothing wrong with your meal at the local Taco Palace? Five stars.</p>
<p>Noticed the bathroom wasn&rsquo;t as clean as you&rsquo;d expect at the Shop-o-Rama? Deduct one, maybe two. Now it&rsquo;s a three star experience.</p>
<p>This inflates scores up towards &ldquo;perfect.&rdquo; Anything that essentially passes the bar without complaints is as good as it can get. There&rsquo;s no room to differentiate the top end.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m strongly of the opinion that average experiences deserve an average rating. If you read a book and it was basically fine, no real complaints, but nothing stands out as exceptional? That should get a 50%. On the rare occasions that I see people doing this, it results in a lot of&hellip; Well. Let&rsquo;s call it &ldquo;feedback.&rdquo; So many people are accustomed to a perfect score being baseline from which complaints are subtracted that giving something that&rsquo;s essentially okay a 50% is likely to result in outrage from people that would agree with you that it&rsquo;s basically fine. The problem isn&rsquo;t that they think it&rsquo;s better than you do, it&rsquo;s that they think that mediocrity deserves a 90%+ score.</p>
<p>Again, it seems to me this is primarily an American thing.</p>
<p>Maybe it&rsquo;s because I see absolutely no value in maintaining the status quo where it doesn&rsquo;t make any sense to me, I&rsquo;ve never used this style of rating. Usually that means I need to publish a rubric.</p>
<p>For example, here&rsquo;s my rubric for recipes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>1 star: not good as-is, could be redeemed. Research and try again.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>2 star: one person liked this, but not both.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>3 star: we both liked this and would like to have it again.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>4 star: very good, should make once per month.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>5 star: the very best, should make every week.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Three stars is a perfectly fine recipe that we both liked. There&rsquo;s literally nothing wrong with it.</p>
<h2 id="okay-but-so-why">Okay, but, so&hellip; Why?</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;m in the process of setting up <a href="https://rpggeek.com/">RPGGeek</a> as the place to track my project of reviewing all these RPG books. They inherited a 10-star rating system from BoardGameGeek. I think it&rsquo;s awful, that&rsquo;s far too many stars, but the communities on that site have done a surprisingly good job of fighting back against rating inflation. The absolutely highest-rated board game has achieved an average rating of 8.60 with almost 50k votes.</p>
<p>But still, I disagree a bit with their published rubric. It&rsquo;s better than most, but I think still trends towards assuming that something basically okay should have a score of 6.</p>
<p>For RPG items, they publish this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>10 - Outstanding. Rules and concepts well presented and a near perfect fit to your play style. Excellent writing. Excellent Editing. Highly consistent throughout. You would highly recommend this book/product.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>9 - Excellent. Same as 10 but lacking in one or more of the elements (writing style, editing, consistency).</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>8 - Very Good. Rules and concepts are a good fit to your play style with some reservations. Solid writing. Solid Editing. Highly consistent throughout.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>7 - Good. Same as 8 but lacking in one of the elements (writing style, editing, consistency).</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>6 - Above Average. Rules and concepts are a reasonable fit to your play style but there are significant sections which you would change or not use in actual play. Solid writing. Solid Editing. Highly consistent throughout.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>5 - Average. Same as 6 but lacking in one of the elements (writing style, editing, consistency).</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>4 - Below Average. Rules and concepts are not a great fit to your play style and there are significant sections which you would change or not use in actual play. You would cherry pick a few ideas from such a book and discard the rest. Solid writing. Solid Editing. Highly consistent throughout.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>3 - Well Below Average. Same as 4 but lacking in one of the elements (writing style, editing, consistency).</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>2 - Poor. Rules and concepts are not likely to mesh at all with your play style and there are precious few things you can cull from this book to use in your actual play. Solid writing. Solid Editing. Highly consistent throughout.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>1 - Horrible. Same as 2 but lacking in one of the elements (writing style, editing, consistency).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s more thought than I see most sites giving the problem, but I want to propose an alternative.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>5 - Average. You would play this game. There is nothing particularly good nor bad about it. It&rsquo;s fine.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Okay, what moves us up the scale from a 5? I can think of three areas of analysis: mythos, production, mechanics.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Mythos</strong> - How interesting is the game&rsquo;s world? How evocative is the writing? Am I excited about the stories it wants to tell?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Production</strong> - How well-produced is the book? Art, writing, graphic design. How do the materials feel? Is this an object of beauty?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Mechanics</strong> - How playable is the game? Does it provide systems that are fun to engage with? How portable are those systems?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So let&rsquo;s pin a perfect 10 in our scale.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>10 - Outstanding. The world is vibrant and interesting, the stories are evocative. The item is finely produced and would be worthy of display. It is an art object in and of itself. The mechanics are interesting, clearly presented, and weave together to support the stories of the mythos.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And with that, I think we can pin a 1.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>1 - Horrible. This item has no redeeming qualities. The stories are not interesting, the world lacks color and flavor. The item itself is utilitarian and otherwise poorly produced. You would not want people to see it on your bookshelf. The mechanics offer nothing new or interesting. Best case scenario it&rsquo;s a retread of something other games have done better.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This scale lends itself really well to a four star system, where a book with none of these things would be a 1, and if it had all three it&rsquo;d be a perfect four. But I don&rsquo;t get to set the system on RPGGeek. One option is to map my system on to theirs. My four-star would be their 10-star, and then down by 3 for each intermediary. 10, 7, 4, and jump to 1 in the worst case. This has benefits and weaknesses. The best argument against it is that it loses granularity. What if there&rsquo;s one really good system, but the rest is trash? What if the cover is truly beautiful, but the pages inside phoned it in?</p>
<p>I can smooth out my system by taking my three axis ratings and giving each a half-step version that differentiates between &ldquo;they did this one thing really well&rdquo; and &ldquo;the whole system knocks it out of the park.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 id="so-then-i-created-a-spreadsheet">So then I created a spreadsheet&hellip;</h2>
<p>It turns out there&rsquo;s an &ldquo;easy&rdquo; solution to this problem. If by easy you mean &ldquo;Contrariwise is a crazy person who is totally unreasonable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Say it with me. (Or don&rsquo;t.) &ldquo;Weighted averages.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Imagine my three categories above: mythos, production, and mechanics. I can grade each of those on a scale from 1-5 where:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>5 - It knocked it out of the park in this category, the whole item is a delight throughout.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>4 - The item mostly succeeded, with a small number of critiques.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>3 - It&rsquo;s fine.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>2 - There&rsquo;s one or two redeemable qualities or systems, but mostly this ain&rsquo;t it chief.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>1 - Nope. No thanks.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If I rate each category on that scale, 1-5, then I can calculate the average of all of those rankings and arrive at a percentage. 5/5 in all three gets you a ten. 3/5 in all three gets you a five. (Really I&rsquo;d need 2.5 to do that, but it can be fudged in the formula.) 1/5 in all three&hellip; You get the picture.</p>
<p>So I think that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m going to plan to do. For now. I might revisit this after I&rsquo;ve tried it a few times. I might be missing things that end up being important. But it&rsquo;s a starting point, and I&rsquo;ve explained my reasoning so that if anyone ever wonders why I gave THAT BELOVED CLASSIC a &ldquo;5&rdquo; there&rsquo;s some chance of defending why. I mean. There&rsquo;s no accounting for taste.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;m not &ldquo;traditionally&rdquo; goal motivated. What do I mean by that? I mean if I tried to set a goal for a year from now that looked something like this: &ldquo;in one year I want to have written a book,&rdquo; that would not, on its own, result in any of the behaviors that lead to a book being written.</p>
<p>At the end of the year there would be no book, and also I would not feel bad. I do not experience any intrinsic desire to accomplish those kinds of goals, whether they&rsquo;re set by me or for me, and I do not feel any sense of loss, guilt, or shame for it.</p>
<p>So what does motivate me? Checking boxes on a todo list. Concrete accomplishment. A list of tasks to do, and the doing of them. It scratches something primal in my brain.</p>
<p>Put me in a video game where I can do anything I want but which provides no structure or list of tasks, and I&rsquo;ll be bored in less than fifteen minutes. (Sorry Morrowind and Oblivion, this is why we never got along.) But, ah, Skyrim! The first Elder Scrolls game to reliably produce a quest log that would direct me towards the interesting places? I sank easily a hundred hours into Skyrim.</p>
<p>So why mention it? I have a &ldquo;problem&rdquo; I&rsquo;m trying to &ldquo;solve&rdquo; and I think without this context it wouldn&rsquo;t make any sense at all why I see it as a problem, or why I feel like the solution needs to work in certain ways.</p>
<p>I have a truly fantastic collection of old <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tabletop_role-playing_game">TTRPG</a> source books. Originally I started collecting the first edition of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exalted">Exalted</a> because it lives rent-free in my head and I had, at one point, owned almost all of them but sold them off at a time where I desperately needed the money. I could talk at length about Exalted and I probably should at some point, but for various reasons it was an also-ran in the early-2000s RPG zeitgeist. You&rsquo;re forgiven if you&rsquo;ve never heard of it, most people haven&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>At one point a few years back I was trying to figure out what my &ldquo;next thing&rdquo; would be. I was successful and comfortable in a stagnant job with no growth opportunities and less challenge. At that time I thought one of the options could be to write my own TTRPG supplements, or to become a creator in that space. I thought maybe one opportunity would be to take all these old RPGs that mostly nobody remembers and try to resurface their best ideas.</p>
<p>Which brings me to my &ldquo;problem.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It would be really, really cool to read these books. I used to read TTRPG handbooks like they were novels when I was a teenager with a potato computer and dial-up internet and very little else to do but read. Now I&rsquo;m a busy adult with many important things to do and it&rsquo;s hard to find the time even for the things I know I love.</p>
<p>Given what I said at the top of the post, I think the likelihood that I actually do that improves a lot if I turn it into a list of tasks. A todo. Which, yes, I could probably do in <a href="https://www.omnigroup.com/omnifocus">Omnifocus</a> where I keep all of my other structural tasks. But I think &ldquo;read an entire 300 page book&rdquo; is probably too large of an ask for the kinds of things I usually keep in my routine todo list. I still use something that looks an awful lot like a version of <a href="https://gettingthingsdone.com/what-is-gtd/">Getting Things Done</a>. I strive to decompose big tasks into lots of little tasks so that it&rsquo;s easier to build momentum. I guess that&rsquo;d be possible with a book, but I think odds are I&rsquo;d spend more time managing that system than reading.</p>
<p>The answer to this that I&rsquo;ve imagined is to create the &ldquo;task&rdquo; structure for this project on my blog. To have a list of the books I need to read, broken down by system, always visible in a side bar. Books that haven&rsquo;t been read shouldn&rsquo;t be links, books that have been read should link to the blog post about them, where I would like to review their content, provide interesting context, and ideally surface whatever the best ideas of that book were.</p>
<p>And, if at all possible, I would like to avoid tedious hand maintenance of that list. Ideally I would be able to mark the posts somehow to link them to their record in the &ldquo;todo&rdquo; list, and then have the rest &ldquo;just work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If this sounds familiar, it&rsquo;s because I stole this idea from someone smarter than me. Like pretty much all of my best ideas. Sadly, I don&rsquo;t remember the name of the blog that did this, but I have a very clear picture in my mind of the format it used. List of links on the right. Every book for every TTRPG system they had, some linked to the review page and others just placeholders for the books yet to be reviewed. Probably they were doing the hard part by hand, because I think a sane person probably would.</p>
<p>Here are the options I&rsquo;ve currently thought of:</p>
<ol>
<li>Do it by hand.</li>
<li>Use a category.</li>
<li>Use a blogroll or similar plugin.</li>
<li>Use a datasource.</li>
<li>Create a second, related blog and put it there.</li>
</ol>
<p>I&rsquo;m unhappy with all of them. Why?</p>
<p><strong>Do it by hand:</strong> mainly, I&rsquo;ll forget. But also it&rsquo;s tedious. Also this is the year of our <a href="https://www.opry.com/">Opry</a> 2024, and it seems like something that software should be able to solve for me.</p>
<p><strong>Use a category:</strong> I think this would work well for publishing, but I lose the ability to have a list of unpublished posts. There&rsquo;s no good way to placeholder out what remains to be done.</p>
<p><strong>Use a blogroll:</strong> also seems to lose the ability to have a list of unpublished posts. Most of the plugins that are designed to do this really want to link to pages that exist.</p>
<p><strong>Use a datasource:</strong> actually seems to get the closest to what I think I&rsquo;d want, but requires me to hand-maintain a CSV or JSON file which is only marginally better than doing it as HTML directly in the template.</p>
<p><strong>Create a second blog:</strong> is, first and foremost, probably too much work. I&rsquo;ve got some experience with hugo, and two previous blogs that used it. There&rsquo;s a reason I now gladly pay for <a href="https://micro.blog/">micro.blog</a> instead. If I upgraded my plan, I could get a second micro.blog, but I think that then has all the same technical limitations AND now I&rsquo;ve bifurcated my online presence, defeating the purpose of trying to centralize on thewizardly.com in the first place.</p>
<p>So what do I do? At the moment, get stalled in analysis paralysis. But I think the play might be to do it by hand just to get started. If I limit the scope to just one TTRPG system (say, for example, Exalted,) then it&rsquo;s not actually that much to maintain. And once I get something up and visible and people can see what it is I&rsquo;m trying to do, I might be able to get someone who knows hugo/micro.blog better than I to suggest an even better way to achieve the result.</p>
<p>Plus, then I&rsquo;m actually doing the thing I want to do: reading and posting about these books. Not tinkering with a website that I would mostly prefer not to spend a lot of time tinkering with.</p>

			 <p>I really hated the Libre 2 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_glucose_monitor">continuous glucose monitor</a> (CGM.) A friend asked for some detail about why, which lead me down a long-winded story about the last five years of my health journey. About halfway through I thought &ldquo;this should be a blog post.&rdquo; So&hellip;</p>
<h2 id="everything">EVERYTHING</h2>
<p>Like my mother before me, I&rsquo;m a type 2 diabetic. I have tried just about every common intervention known to humankind. If it exists, and a doctor knows how to prescribe it, I&rsquo;ve probably taken it.</p>
<p>The most successful intervention I ever discovered was a combination of intermittent fasting, long fasts, and &ldquo;not really keto but sort of basically keto.&rdquo; I had an 8-hour daily eating window, occasional fasts that ranged all the way up to a week, and cutting the added sugar from just about everything but not going wholesale anti-carb.</p>
<p>I lost a truly fantastic amount of weight, was able to stop all my diabetes-related medications, and was generally the healthiest I&rsquo;ve been as an adult.</p>
<p>Despite hitting my lowest adult weight and the general level of my success, I was not at a weight my doctor considered ideal, and so he encouraged me to try semaglutide. I&rsquo;m not here to throw him under a bus, I think I have a pretty good doctor and he&rsquo;s been thoughtful and supportive all along. However, the promise of not having to work quite so hard to maintain this house of cards lead my entire non-pharmaceutical intervention strategy to crumble. And I mean, really crumble. Roman empire level of collapse.</p>
<p>Semaglutide didn&rsquo;t work for me. I mean it did, sort of technically, but not in the way one would want it to. I gained weight the entire time I was on it, but slower than I would have if I were left to my own devices. It had an effect, just not enough of one. Slowly, over the course of about a year, I regained all of the weight I lost. A new job during the time period and its associated stresses couldn&rsquo;t have helped.</p>
<h2 id="everywhere">EVERYWHERE</h2>
<p>Around December of this year we decided to try switching me from semaglutide to tirzepatide. I know lots of people who&rsquo;ve had truly amazing results on tirzepatide. My insurance company did what insurance companies do. They couldn&rsquo;t outright deny the prior-authorization. I fully qualify by their own standards. So they wrapped me up in so much paperwork trying to prove it that I decided fasting would be easier. Congratulations American healthcare system, you won.</p>
<p>Late March I decided to try a new fasting protocol that I had encountered called rolling fasts. Roughly 90 hours of fasting followed by a &ldquo;re-feed&rdquo; meal, followed by a new fast. This actually works great for me, for many reasons, and I think I probably won&rsquo;t go into all of them.</p>
<p>Shortly after I started I had some concerning symptoms that I will spare you the details of. It was enough to be concerned maybe the fasting wasn&rsquo;t safe. A couple months of fits and starts and diagnosis, we figured out it was unrelated and the problem passed. Ever since, I&rsquo;ve been happily maintaining a rolling fast without significant issue.</p>
<p>One of the things I like about rolling fasts is that I only eat once every four days, and that means I&rsquo;m rarely needing to figure out dinner at the last minute, which leads to making much better decisions about what to eat. And I&rsquo;m not saying perfectly healthy by any stretch of the imagination. But I am saying that I never run out to Taco Bell right after work because I forgot to buy groceries and accidentally falling mouth-first into a pile of spicy potato tacos.</p>
<p>I get a few days to really figure out what I&rsquo;m craving, and then whatever it is I get to go have it. Honestly? It&rsquo;s the healthiest emotional relationship with food I&rsquo;ve ever had.</p>
<h2 id="all-at-once">ALL AT ONCE</h2>
<p>Yesterday was my mid-year blood draw, and the results for my blood sugar aren&rsquo;t exactly grim, but they&rsquo;re not where I&rsquo;d want them to be. This has prompted some introspection. The main problem as I currently see it is that I don&rsquo;t have a good and reliable way to monitor my blood sugar during the fast and re-feed. And that&rsquo;s how we get to the topic of CGMs.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t mind a finger poke, but I think that method is highly susceptible to the games one can play with when they choose to check. Before a meal, fully fasted? Great! Perfect numbers! An hour after the only meal I&rsquo;ll have that week? High! But for how long? Who knows! My sense of blood sugar is that one of the things that really matters is how long it takes to come back down to a normal level after eating, and that&rsquo;s the kind of data one really only gets through a CGM. It matters a bit how high it spikes, but I&rsquo;m mostly not eating cake for dinner. What really matters is if I&rsquo;m spending the first two days of a four day fast just waiting for my blood sugar to come back down to a fasted state.</p>
<p>So I think I need to get back on a CGM, which I plan to talk to my doctor about at our next appointment. But I&rsquo;d like to try some of the other options that aren&rsquo;t the Libre 2, which as I mentioned, I hate. Loathe. Despise entirely. Some searching indicates the Libre 3 might not have any of the key problems that frustrated me, and the Dexcom Stelo is supposed to be coming sometime this summer.</p>
<p>The important thing from my perspective is to find a source of reliable data from which to act. I can&rsquo;t diagnose the machine if none of the sensors are working.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;ve spent the last several weeks using <a href="https://track.toggl.com">Toggl</a> to track 100% of my time, and the results have been interesting.</p>
<h3 id="reasoning">Reasoning</h3>
<p>On a flight to who knows where I read <a href="https://hbr.org/2023/12/use-strategic-thinking-to-create-the-life-you-want">Use Strategic Thinking to Create the Life You Want</a> and thought it had some interesting ideas to try, one of which was to rate certain areas of my life on a matrix of how important it was to me and how much time I spent on it.</p>
<p>There are some areas of my life that I don&rsquo;t think I spend enough time on, but my intuitive sense is that my time is mostly well-managed given that I only have 24 hours a day to work with. It seemed like an interesting experiment to try tracking 100% of my time for a while to see how well it lined up with my subjective experience.</p>
<h3 id="methodology">Methodology</h3>
<p>In the article they talk about &ldquo;Strategic Life Units&rdquo; (SLU) as the sixteen key areas where people spend their time. I set up a new Toggl workspace following that outline with six &ldquo;Strategic Life Areas&rdquo; (Relationships, Body Mind Spirit, Community, Profession, Interests, and Personal Care,) as clients assigned to the SLUs as projects.</p>
<p>My list of SLUs (plus, where applicable, examples):</p>
<ul>
<li>Mental Health</li>
<li>Physical Health - Exercise, but also going to the doctor.</li>
<li>Spiritual Health</li>
<li>Community - Local clubs, civic engagement. If elections were going on, I&rsquo;d put them here.</li>
<li>Society - Volunteering, activism.</li>
<li>Hobbies</li>
<li>Offline Entertainment - Going to a show or movie. Reading a book. Non-interactive entertainment. Touching grass.</li>
<li>Online Entertainment - Video games, streaming, general-purpose computing.</li>
<li>Daily Life - Errands, groceries.</li>
<li>Physiological Needs - Sleep, care of the meat chariot in which my brain resides.</li>
<li>Education</li>
<li>Finances</li>
<li>Work</li>
<li>Family</li>
<li>Friendship</li>
<li>Significant Other</li>
</ul>
<p>Where an activity could plausibly fit under two categories, I tried to pick the category where it fit &ldquo;best&rdquo; and then be consistent about it. For example, a meal which I ate alone would fall under &ldquo;Physiological Needs,&rdquo; but a meal eaten with friends would fall under &ldquo;Friendship.&rdquo;</p>
<h3 id="results">Results</h3>
<p>Aggregated over the last four weeks the majority of my time falls into one of four categories. The big winners, in order:</p>
<ul>
<li>40% Physiological Needs</li>
<li>27% Online Entertainment</li>
<li>17% Work</li>
<li>6% Hobbies</li>
</ul>
<p>The remaining 10% is split between a few different things, with Significant Other and Daily Life leading the pack at around 3.7% each.</p>
<p>So how do I feel about that?</p>
<p>Physiological Needs feels about right, since I used it to track (among other things) the time I was sleeping. And I sleep a lot. I always have. Being well rested is a super power and the older I get the more certain I am that time spent sleeping is time well spent.</p>
<p>But I was shocked to see how much time I spend on Online Entertainment. Now, granted, this might be a particularly unusual period. Two different four-day weekends fell during this period. Even still, looking at an average work day, it&rsquo;s the most likely thing to fill in the majority of the time between work and sleep.</p>
<p>Work seems basically fine, again considering the number of PTO days that fell in the sample period.</p>
<p>Hobbies is&hellip; Abysmal. Of that 6%, the majority was actually time spent cooking. Now I happen to think, for me, it&rsquo;s fair and accurate to count cooking time as hobby time. I absolutely love to do it. And the only reason there wasn&rsquo;t more of it is that I fast more days of the week than not. On days where I was planning to eat, cooking usually accounted for at least a few hours. It&rsquo;s time well spent. But all of my other hobbies (of which, honestly, there are too many,) are generally languishing.</p>
<h3 id="next-steps">Next Steps</h3>
<p>I would like to see Online Entertainment come down. The four biggest sources contributing to Online Entertainment during this time were:</p>
<ul>
<li>&ldquo;Game&rdquo; - Basically playing some game. This does make sense given the Steam Sale, and might be unusually high given my PTO.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Computing&rdquo; - My catch-all category for time spent &ldquo;farting around&rdquo; on a computer. This could be social chatting, it could be reading RSS.</li>
<li>&ldquo;WoW&rdquo; - Specifically playing World of Warcraft.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Good Eats&rdquo; - Rewatching the TV show Good Eats, which I enjoy especially mid-fast when all I want to do is plan my next meal.</li>
</ul>
<p>I enjoy gaming, and I think it could rightly be tracked as hobby instead, so I think I&rsquo;m going to monitor it for another few weeks and see if it stays as high as it has. Not yet concerned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Computing&rdquo; is, generally speaking, not time well spent. There&rsquo;s some important stuff that gets lumped in there mostly because I forget to update Toggl, but I think driving that down is a worthy goal.</p>
<p>World of Warcraft is, at this point, more of a social opportunity than a game. There was an event running during part of the sample period that I think lead to more than the usual amount of playing, so I do want to keep an eye on that, but also there&rsquo;s a new expansion due towards the end of the summer that would drive this back up. The important thing to me is to not spend &ldquo;idle time&rdquo; in WoW, and I almost never do that.</p>
<p>Good Eats and the watching of streaming in general is not awful, and I suspect less than what would be considered &ldquo;average,&rdquo; but I would prefer to spend at least some of that time working on hobbies instead. No concrete plans there, but something to keep in mind.</p>
<p>What do I want to see more of? Friendship, Significant Other, and Hobbies.</p>
<p>In an average month I see friends in the real world approximately once. I don&rsquo;t know many people who live near me, because I moved to the middle of nowhere during the pandemic. I do like living here, but I wish I had more social connections that didn&rsquo;t require a flight. I&rsquo;ve also slowly become awful at maintaining my digital friendships, and I likely need to do something about that.</p>
<p>My SO and I live together, and do a lot together, and I think that&rsquo;s mostly getting lumped into other categories out of convenience. It&rsquo;d be nice to be more intentional about that.</p>
<p>Entire swathes of my hobbies have been ignored for truly worrying amounts of time. I haven&rsquo;t run a TTRPG campaign in going on three years now, and the last time I worked on my Warhammer armies was probably March.</p>
<h3 id="summary">Summary</h3>
<p>Tracking 100% of my time for a few weeks was really eye-opening. I &ldquo;waste&rdquo; more time than I would have guessed, and it seems like I should be able to come up with some systems to help me be better about that. But there are also places where I&rsquo;m right on track, and if nothing else it&rsquo;s nice to know where those are.</p>

<h2 id="mushroom-paté">Mushroom Paté</h2>
<h3 id="ingredients">Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
<li>1/2 lb shiitake mushrooms, chopped</li>

<li>Mix all of the ingredients together, then separate the beef into four oval patties.</li>
<li>Grill or fry the patties via your method of choice. I grilled them on a pellet grill at 450 for 9 minutes per side.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="final-assembly">Final Assembly</h2>
<p>I made these with two mini baguettes cut in half down the middle because I live in the middle of nowhere and that was the closest thing I could get to the traditional sandwich roll. I think in the future I&rsquo;ll make these on brioche buns just for practicality. The sandwiches wouldn&rsquo;t close.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://thewizardly.com/2023/11/04/freshly-repaired-cleaned.html">mantle clock</a> is running strong, but about five minutes fast per day. It uses a balance wheel, which is a particularly fragile and difficult-to-adjust mechanism, so I haven&rsquo;t taken it down and tried to fix that yet.</p>
<p>The grandfather clock is out for repairs <a href="https://theoldfashionway.com/">with a professional</a>. Again. He thinks he&rsquo;s found the source of the problem, and intends to publish a youtube video about it. I think it&rsquo;s probably a good (or bad) sign when someone has to post a video about a new and interesting way that a clock can break. (It was magnets.)</p>
<h3 id="minidisc">MiniDisc</h3>
<p>Since he was here to collect all the parts of the grandfather clock, I asked the clock guy (who also does radio repairs,) if he wanted to take a swing at <a href="https://www.minidisc.wiki/equipment/sony/portable/mz-e3">one of my MiniDisc players</a>. It was sold as non-functional with the description of &ldquo;makes a whooshing noise.&rdquo; I bought it because it came with what turned out to be a true goldmine of discs recorded &ldquo;by a Los Angeles DJ.&rdquo; The player was in beautiful physical condition, and it&rsquo;s now repaired and working after a swap of the digital to analog converter.</p>
<p>Oh, and I bought a copy of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_Moods">Pure Moods</a> on CD to convert over to MD, because it feels somehow cosmically right. Also the way this particular album looms in the psyche of people who were kids in the 90s. Young me would probably be ecstatic that we finally had a copy.</p>
<h3 id="ttrpgs">TTRPGs</h3>
<p>I think I&rsquo;ve lost one of my <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earthdawn">Earthdawn</a> books somewhere in the house. I&rsquo;ve done a thorough-enough search to think that maybe I never actually had it, but there&rsquo;s some anecdata to suggest that I did. Unrelated to that, I was able to find a copy of <a href="http://www.itcamefromthebookshelf.com/2022/01/earthdawn-1e-prelude-to-war.html">Prelude to War</a> at a local(-ish) used book store, leaving only four books missing from my 1e Earthdawn collection.</p>
<p>At the same time I also picked up <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Complete_Sha%27ir%27s_Handbook">The Complete Sha&rsquo;ir&rsquo;s Handbook</a>, which is wizard archetypes for the old D&amp;D setting of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Qadim">Al-Qadim</a>. It&rsquo;s in pristine condition and was a pretty penny in the bookstore&rsquo;s rare book room. I usually prefer to buy play copies, because Toys Are Meant to be Played With, but sometimes with these old TTRPG books it&rsquo;s either buy the perfect copy at collector&rsquo;s prices or accept I won&rsquo;t own it. Even play copies are rare. These old D&amp;D settings are interesting to me, and the books are often very &ldquo;of their time&rdquo; in an almost charmingly unaware way. Nobody who wrote this book had ever heard the word appropriation, and it usually shows.</p>
<p>The hardbound copy of <a href="https://possumcreekgames.com/pages/yazebas-bed-breakfast">Yazeba&rsquo;s Bed and Breakfast</a> finally arrived. It went directly on a shelf, because I don&rsquo;t currently have the capacity to do anything with it, but I remember being charmed by the concept and thinking it might be light enough to convince some local friends to pick up casually without having to resort to digital play. With all due apologies to people who can only ever get their gaming group together on Discord, it&rsquo;s not the same.</p>
<h3 id="world-of-warcraft">World of Warcraft</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.wowhead.com/guide/wow-remix-mists-of-pandaria-overview">WoW Remix: Mists of Pandaria</a> is probably the best and smartest thing Blizzard has done since Wrath of the Lich King. No I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m being hyperbolic. It&rsquo;s that good. I think part of why it&rsquo;s that good is that it&rsquo;s meant to be a limited duration event, which means that it can be fun in a way which is not also trying to prolong my subscription past its natural lifespan. It&rsquo;s not trying to sell me any DLC.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a reminder that somewhere in the shambling husk of Blizzard Activision is the beating heart of the company that made Warcraft 3 and Diablo 2. That, if they weren&rsquo;t in the throes of a dark insanity known as shareholder primacy, they might actually be capable of doing the one thing anyone actually wants them to do: making a good game.</p>
<p>I hope they keep this format and go on to do it for other expansions. I&rsquo;d be especially glad to see it of Shadowlands, the one expansion I never got around to playing.</p>

			 <p>I had the great fortune to spend the last week or so sailing along Alaska&rsquo;s inside passage on the NCL Jewel. Being the kind of person that I am, I gave myself a side-quest on day one: eat at and review each of the on-board dining options. I mostly succeeded, with two notable exceptions. It turns out a reservation at the Teppanyaki restaurant is incredibly difficult to score, and I simply ran out of time for the steakhouse.</p>
<h2 id="but-first-the-rubric">But First, the Rubric</h2>
<p>Taking inspiration from Michelin stars, I decided to categorize each dining option with the Contrariwise Boat Emoji System. Boatmoji if you will.</p>
<ul>
<li>0 (Zero) boats - Anything I wouldn&rsquo;t expressly recommend. Runs the gamut from terrible to basically fine. Might be perfectly cromulent, but doesn&rsquo;t stand out.</li>
<li>1 (One) boats 🛳️ - Worth a visit. If it requires a reservation, consider making one.</li>
<li>2 (Two) boats 🛳️🛳️ - Plan around it. Get at least one reservation, at any day or time you can, and schedule other things to accommodate.</li>
<li>3 (Three) boats 🛳️🛳️🛳️ - Vacation highlight. Take a cruise specifically to go to this restaurant.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-restaurants">The Restaurants</h2>
<h3 id="osheehans">O&rsquo;Sheehans</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Rating</strong>: 0 boats</li>
<li><strong>Style</strong>: Casual</li>
<li><strong>Cuisine</strong>: Bar food</li>
</ul>
<p>Generally speaking, O&rsquo;Sheehans had both the worst food and worst service of the trip. It&rsquo;s the kind of place you go to kill 1.5 hours waiting on the smallest plate of nachos you&rsquo;ve seen in your life. As everywhere on the boat, the staff were both patient and kind. I think the delays were frequently because the O&rsquo;Sheehans kitchen is also providing room service, and so no matter how busy (or not) the restaurant appeared to be, I suspect there were at least double as many tickets accounted for by room service requests.</p>
<p>The nominal benefit of O&rsquo;Sheehans is that it&rsquo;s open 24 hours, has no dress code, and no reservations. But I think I&rsquo;d recommend the buffet categorically over O&rsquo;Sheehans at any time when the buffet is open and operating.</p>
<p>Speaking of&hellip;</p>
<h3 id="garden-cafe-the-buffet">Garden Cafe (The Buffet)</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Rating</strong>: 0 boats</li>
<li><strong>Style</strong>: Buffet</li>
<li><strong>Cuisine</strong>: Rotating</li>
</ul>
<p>Buffet (noun): the opportunity to eat as much as you would like of food that would not be acceptable at any other time.</p>
<p>Jokes aside, I actually rather liked the buffet, and I think it&rsquo;s the &ldquo;set point&rdquo; for all other on-ship dining. O&rsquo;Sheehans falls slightly below, most other things are equal are slightly above. The buffet is fine. It never really excelled, but it was reliable. It always made for a quick breakfast or lunch, but I never made it for dinner generally preferring to work on my quest to eat at every other option. I think the buffet is never the wrong option, especially if you&rsquo;re in a hurry or don&rsquo;t want to wait to be seated.</p>
<h3 id="le-bistro">Le Bistro</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Rating</strong>: 🛳️ (1 Boat)</li>
<li><strong>Style</strong>: Fine Dining</li>
<li><strong>Cuisine</strong>: French</li>
</ul>
<p>Le Bistro is the one place on the ship that had a dress code, and despite a few ruffled feathers about whether or not my collared sweater qualified (it did,) I had a mostly pleasant experience. I think that other options on the boat win for atmosphere, but the food here never disappointed. I can strongly recommend both the escargot and the french onion soup. There are other restaurants on the ship that will claim to have french onion, but none of them will be as good as what Le Bistro serves.</p>
<p>What really stole the show for me was the dessert at Le Bistro, a strawberries and cream fraisier with pistachio topping. I would rank it as &ldquo;dangerously good&rdquo; and worth the price of admission alone.</p>
<h3 id="chin-chin">Chin Chin</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Rating</strong>: 🛳️ (1 Boat)</li>
<li><strong>Style</strong>: Casual</li>
<li><strong>Cuisine</strong>: Chinese</li>
</ul>
<p>We had to wait an hour to sit at Chin Chin, and I can see why. I ordered the kung pao chicken and I&rsquo;m somewhat at a loss for how to describe it. Spicy teriyaki chicken? Clearly non-traditional, none of the flavors that I expected, and yet somehow still incredible. Maybe they went with that name due to familiarity, maybe they just don&rsquo;t know how to make kung pao and lucked into something that works? I won&rsquo;t fault them for the non-traditional take, because it so clearly worked and was clearly at least inspired by kung pao with a spice that both built and lingered. A friend had many compliments about their chicken fried rice, and several people got calamari that was lightly fried but not chewy, the hallmark of well-prepared squid.</p>
<p>The highlight of my dinner at Chin Chin was actually a cross-order which deserves its own section&hellip;</p>
<h3 id="sushi-by-way-of-chin-chin">Sushi (by way of Chin Chin)</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Rating</strong>: 🛳️🛳️ (2 Boats)</li>
<li><strong>Style</strong>: Counter seating</li>
<li><strong>Cuisine</strong>: Sushi</li>
</ul>
<p>It&rsquo;s possible to book directly into the sushi restaurant, but it can also be ordered from Chin Chin, which is what I did in order to save time. I can&rsquo;t overstate how good it was; at $11 for two pieces of nigiri, it had better have been. But I want to be clear, the sushi on board the NCL Jewel is among the best I&rsquo;ve ever had.</p>
<h3 id="la-cucina">La Cucina</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Rating</strong>: 0 boats</li>
<li><strong>Style</strong>: Casual</li>
<li><strong>Cuisine</strong>: Italian</li>
</ul>
<p>The vibe, as they say, was immaculate. Better than Le Bistro&rsquo;s no doubt. But the food didn&rsquo;t live up to the same expectation. It was fine, maybe even two points north of acceptable. But hard to recommend. If you like Olive Garden, you&rsquo;ll like La Cucina. I think the gnocchi where my highlight, and probably the best gnocchi I had all week.</p>
<h3 id="azura--tsars-palace">Azura / Tsar&rsquo;s Palace</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Rating</strong>: 0 boats</li>
<li><strong>Style</strong>: Casual</li>
<li><strong>Cuisine</strong>: Rotating</li>
</ul>
<p>Azura and the Tsar&rsquo;s Palace are two sides of the same coin. Either or both could be referred to as &ldquo;main dining,&rdquo; with the only real difference between them being the ambiance and decor. I will note that we found the service in Tsar&rsquo;s Palace to be slightly more reliable. Nominally the more casual option, Azura, reminded me of just about every &ldquo;fast-casual&rdquo; restaurant I&rsquo;ve eaten at.</p>
<p>The food choices changed slightly throughout the week, but were generally the kind of thing you might find at Chili&rsquo;s or Applebees, and about the same quality overall. Tsar&rsquo;s palace offered the same menu, but with an interior designed to evoke old-style regal charm. For what it&rsquo;s worth, the palace also had bathrooms inside the restaurant, a rare luxury on the Jewel.</p>
<h3 id="moderno-churrascaria">Moderno Churrascaria</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Rating</strong>: 0 boats</li>
<li><strong>Style</strong>: Buffet</li>
<li><strong>Cuisine</strong>: Brazilian</li>
</ul>
<p>In what I&rsquo;m certain will be my most controversial opinion, Moderno was&hellip; Okay? I guess? I&rsquo;m not convinced it was better than Garden Cafe, except that I paid $70 for it. Like other Brazilian Steakhouses the gimmick is mostly that people walk around and carve fresh hunks of animal directly on to your plate. I&rsquo;m mostly of the opinion that those animal hunks were&hellip; Fine? I guess? Neither the quality nor flavor really stood out from among all the other animal hunks I had on the boat.</p>
<p>The salad bar portion of Moderno was marginally upscaled compared to Garden Cafe. They had manchego cheese, which I like, and the charcuterie was decent. It felt sort of like something I might have thrown together for some friends that I wanted to impress but like&hellip; Not too much? Basically what I&rsquo;m trying to say is that it was okay, but left to my own devices I might spend my dining credits elsewhere.</p>
<h2 id="overall-impressions">Overall Impressions</h2>
<p>Generally, I liked pretty much all of the food I had on the NCL Jewel. I don&rsquo;t think any of it was &ldquo;bad,&rdquo; although much of it was &ldquo;okay.&rdquo; That doesn&rsquo;t really surprise me, and I think there are other cruise lines that lean harder into the food as a draw. I appreciated that for the most part Norwegian doesn&rsquo;t require specific dress codes or assigned seating, something I&rsquo;ve heard other cruise lines still do. I&rsquo;d cruise the NCL Jewel again without hesitation.</p>

			 <p>Language is hard. Communication is harder. When someone receives a communication, they interpret it through their own understanding and world view and the message that&rsquo;s ultimately received may bear only a passing resemblance to the one that was intended. Ideally, we&rsquo;re all working to get better at communicating what we actually intend, since the burden is on the communicator to be understood, not the receiver to interpret.</p>
<p>With this in mind, I&rsquo;m writing this as something of a preemptive &ldquo;disambiguation&rdquo; of some terms I intend to use in future blog posts with two intentions in mind:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>I want to be clear with myself what these words mean and how I should use them, so that hopefully I do not make the mistake of using them in the wrong way such that other people are less likely to understand me.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I want to be clear with everyone else how I am intending to use these words, for the same reason as above.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>In the end my goal is to &ldquo;think in public&rdquo; about the world in a way that helps me understand it better. With any luck, that might also help some other people understand it better, or at least understand me better.</p>
<h2 id="defining-ground-truth">Defining &ldquo;Ground Truth&rdquo;</h2>
<p>When I use the term &ldquo;ground truth&rdquo; I am referring to to what other people might call &ldquo;objective reality.&rdquo; These are the things we, as a society, &ldquo;know.&rdquo; Usually through direct observation, measurement, and empirical evidence.</p>
<p>The earth is round. This is ground truth. Some people &ldquo;believe&rdquo; otherwise. Beliefs are derived from ground truth, but they do not influence ground truth. Our ability to understand ground truth is imperfect, and we may be wrong about some parts of it, but the preponderance of credible sources currently agree.</p>
<p>Often, but not always, it is possible for you to demonstrate ground truth through your own observation or empirical measurement. Eratosthenes of Cyrene <a href="https://www.wired.com/2012/06/june-19-240-b-c-the-earth-is-round-and-its-this-big/">demonstrated the earth was round in 240 B.C.</a> using shadows, an experiment you can run yourself with an afternoon&rsquo;s lazy drive in the car.</p>
<h2 id="defining-belief">Defining &ldquo;Belief&rdquo;</h2>
<p>When I use the term &ldquo;belief&rdquo; I am referring to the entire host of things which a person might hold to be either true or false, but which cannot be empirically proven. These are the things you might &ldquo;know&rdquo; which are not ground truth.</p>
<p>Beliefs are often based on our understanding of ground truth, but sometimes they&rsquo;re not. There are things people believe to their core that have no basis in our shared objective reality. Where people (myself included) get themselves into trouble is conflating the things we happen to believe with truth. I absolutely believe all of the things that I believe happen to be true. I also acknowledge the statistical likelihood of that is approximately zero.</p>
<p>The closer you can get your beliefs to ground truth, the more valuable your insights become. To yourself and to others. I only know of one way to do this, which is to take a cherished belief and really investigate it. Tear it down to its core and figure out why you believe it. Where did you learn the subset of things that made you believe that particular thing? Do they still hold up relative to the other things you know or believe? Beware of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_dissonance">cognitive dissonance</a>.</p>
<h2 id="defining-principles">Defining &ldquo;Principles&rdquo;</h2>
<p>When I say &ldquo;my principles&rdquo; what I really mean are the rules by which I live my life. They are not fundamental ground truth, although in many cases my intention is that they are reflective of it. They&rsquo;re decisions I&rsquo;ve made about what&rsquo;s important, turned into systems.</p>
<p>Principles are like an operating system. They&rsquo;re decisions made in advance about what&rsquo;s important, what matters, and how to respond to various stimuli.</p>
<p>Being vegetarian or vegan is a principle. It comes from a person&rsquo;s understanding of ground truth, their beliefs, and is ultimately codified in the pre-made decision about what they will or won&rsquo;t eat.</p>
<h2 id="other-terms">Other Terms</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;m avoiding defining a few things: ideas, values. Probably others. I think for purposes of the kinds of things I&rsquo;m intending to talk about what constitutes an <strong>idea</strong> won&rsquo;t matter, and <strong>values</strong> are just a specific subspecies of beliefs. There are some academic senses where the distinction matters, but I don&rsquo;t think it will here.</p>
<p>This should be enough of a shared lexicon to get where I&rsquo;m trying to go, or at least to be able to define new terms along the way as necessary.</p>

My experience is that people are busy and they mostly don&rsquo;t click links, so posting links to a blog from a microblog is a great way to make sure your blog never gets read. Having one stream that does both is, I think, the best I can get while still being respectful of other peoples' time and attention.</p>

<p>(In situ this question is basically asking if I&rsquo;m aspiring to emulate anyone.) No. I&rsquo;m striving for authenticity. Not, like, &ldquo;branded authenticity.&rdquo; Actually just my real answers, thoughts, and perspectives. One of the reasons why I want to detach this identity from &ldquo;real me&rdquo; is that it allows me to be more real in every way that matters. The day job requires a brand. It requires emulation. This is more &ldquo;me&rdquo; than most people who ever meet me are likely to get.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Do you have a set update frequency and update time for your site?</strong></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;m trying to post roughly weekly, just to build and maintain the habit. I don&rsquo;t kick myself too hard if it I miss it.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>For what maximum period have you stopped updating?</strong></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Since starting this blog, I think at most a couple of weeks. However I&rsquo;ve gone &ldquo;radio silent&rdquo; on the internet for periods of years in other places.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Would you like to get more visitors?</strong></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Yes, but only inasmuch as I always want to attract more of my tribe. I want more visitors who are legitimately interested in the kinds of things I talk about.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Are you happy with the feedback on the content?</strong></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;m happy with all positive, constructive feedback. Reasonable people should be able to disagree about some things, and I&rsquo;m not particularly interested in the kind of vitriol that&rsquo;s standard in other parts of the internet. It&rsquo;s like we forgot, culturally, that it was possible to walk away and not say anything.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>What do you think about typos and broken links?</strong></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>When I notice them, I fix them, but mistakes are the touch of a human&rsquo;s hand. I fear the world where no mistake is permitted far more than someone judging my typo.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Do you accept requests?</strong></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>I think this is probably intended for someone who has an artistic output. My artistic output is primarily words. I think I&rsquo;d take a suggestion on a topic to write about, if I thought I had anything to say, but I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;d take commissioned writing work.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Are there hidden pages?</strong></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Not intentionally! I think I might have toyed around with some plugins on my host that are still technically enabled, but I haven&rsquo;t hidden anything with the intent of it being found.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Do you have another site?</strong></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Several! All defunct. Haven&rsquo;t figured out what to do about that.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Do you allow links? If so, please let me know if there are any conditions.</strong></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Certainly. I would prefer if links stay within the <a href="https://indieweb.org/">IndieWeb</a>. I won&rsquo;t be entirely crushed if I end up linked somewhere out on the Commercial Web, if the end result of that is meeting more of my tribe.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Did you have any experience running another site before starting this one?</strong></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been running sites since the days of Geocities and Angelfire. It&rsquo;s probably for the best that I couldn&rsquo;t remember where any of those were, though. No idea if I&rsquo;m in <a href="https://archive.org/web/geocities.php">the big Geocities dump</a>. Probably?</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>What inspired you to create this site?</strong></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>I needed a place to be able to get thoughts out of my head but which also would allow me to interact with the <a href="https://indieweb.org/">IndieWeb</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fediverse">Fediverse</a>.</p>

<li><strong>When was this site established?</strong></li>

<blockquote>
<p>2023/10/31.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Do you have any celebration plans for the opening anniversary?</strong></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think so! I probably won&rsquo;t even make note of it, if I notice.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Do you keep in mind events such as Halloween and Christmas, seasonal changes, and social trends when updating?</strong></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Not even a little bit. Honestly I sometimes forget to keep those things in mind in day to day life.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Do you use SNS?</strong></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>(&ldquo;SNS&rdquo; is the shorthand term that the Japanese use for &ldquo;social media&rdquo;.) Basically, no. The closest I get is this blog&rsquo;s federation to the Fediverse. You can follow me on Mastodon! I have an account on BlueSky that just reposts everything I post here, to make it easier for people to follow me there until they get <a href="https://atproto.com/guides/overview">ATProtocol</a> fully up and working.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Please tell us why you dare to run a website in this SNS era.</strong></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Because the slow web was a better web. And the small web still is, where it exists and you can find it. Computers are a miracle. We taught sand to think by hitting it with lightning. But that doesn&rsquo;t mean every invention that followed was a net positive for society. I don&rsquo;t think social media actually helps anyone, and I think I&rsquo;d have a pretty high burden of proof to change that prior.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Is there anything you keep in mind when running your site?</strong></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Be honest. Be clear. Be kind. Nobody&rsquo;s ever changed their mind because someone yelled at them.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Is there anything that remains in your mind while running the site?</strong></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>I have a set of principals for engaging with the internet. I&rsquo;ve never written them down. I probably should. It includes not having any kind of intentional tracking on this site. It might be kind of neat to know how many people see it, but I can&rsquo;t preach with one hand that people shouldn&rsquo;t be tracked and then track them. I know that there are services that do a more respectful version of tracking, but I think the correct amount is none. For me and also for everyone else. We should not have opened this pandora&rsquo;s box.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Do you have any problems with site management?</strong></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>No, I pay <a href="https://micro.blog/">micro.blog</a> to do all the hard stuff for me.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Do you ever get embarrassed about content you posted a long time ago and delete it?</strong></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t say I&rsquo;m embarrassed. There&rsquo;s definitely stuff I posted when I was young that is, how they say, &ldquo;cringe&rdquo; by modern standards. It&rsquo;s probably cached in Google and the Wayback machine, if you knew where to look, but I don&rsquo;t. I have never once, in my life, tried to search myself on Google. I think it&rsquo;s probably the correct position, and I&rsquo;d recommend it to everyone.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Have you ever thought about quitting the site?</strong></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Not this one, but I&rsquo;ve basically &ldquo;quit&rdquo; others when they stopped making sense. Some of which were lost forever, which is a shame.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Do you have backups or other measures in place in case your site suddenly disappears?</strong></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Not yet. I&rsquo;m not invested enough that I think it would be a catatrophe. At some point I know I&rsquo;ll need to set up some kind of archival solution for this site.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>If you were to die tomorrow, would you leave your website behind? Do you want to delete it?</strong></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>I think I&rsquo;d want to leave it. I suspect there are people that would come here, read what I typed, and they&rsquo;d hear it in my voice. And for a short period of time I&rsquo;d still be there. I think a piece of us lives on as long as we&rsquo;re still remembered and thought of. It would be real cool to be the kind of person that people think of long after I&rsquo;m gone.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Are you okay if your family or real-life friends and acquaintances see your site?</strong></li>

<ul>
<li><strong>How much of a difference do you think there is between your online image and your real-life personality?</strong></li>

<p>Less than you&rsquo;d imagine. Authenticity is part of the goal. The only place I&rsquo;m anything other than exactly who I am is work.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>What kind of people do you want to visit your site?</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>Interesting weirdos. Kind people with strong opinions about making the world a better place and realistic plans for achieving it.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Are you registered for searches or rankings?</strong></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>I think I applied to be listed in an IndieWeb / Personal Blog list, but I never followed up and I have no idea if that ever happened. I could probably get listed on Google but I think it&rsquo;s pretty unlikely I&rsquo;d ever rank on any searches so it&rsquo;s not high up my list.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Are you part of an alliance?</strong></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>(This is the Japanese equivalent of a webring.) No. I don&rsquo;t actually know how much those ever worked, if I&rsquo;m being honest. Someone out there probably used them a lot, but I didn&rsquo;t. Maybe if I found one that really seemed align with my kind of weirdo I&rsquo;d get hooked up, but I&rsquo;m not actively seeking that out.</p>

<li><strong>How well do you know the languages used to create homepages, such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP?</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>I&rsquo;m fluent in all of those things, but prefer not to do it. I haven&rsquo;t written a line of PHP since probably 2006? HTML, CSS, and JS are all more recent, but I&rsquo;d rather not unless I absolutely have to.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>When operating your site, do you ever pay attention to the number of accesses and update frequency of other sites?</strong></li>

<p>Not at all. I try not to measure myself against others.</p>

<li><strong>Please let me know if you have any recommendations for sites or books that support site production.</strong></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Look at the source code for sites you think are doing something cool, and see if you can figure out how they did it. Don&rsquo;t steal their entire layout and style, that&rsquo;s what we call Not Cool, but the best way to learn in my experience is to figure out how someone did what you&rsquo;re trying to do.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I back a lot of things on Kickstarter. Like. A lot of things. Especially during the annual <a href="https://updates.kickstarter.com/zine-quest-2023-kickstarters-annual-open-call-for-rpg-zines-returns-in-february/">ZineQuest</a>, where indie TTRPG creators are encouraged to take a chance on the small, wild ideas that sometimes grow up to be Something Big.</p>
<p>At PAX Unplugged I had the chance to speak briefly with one such creator, and they asked me what I looked for when I was deciding to back a project, so this post is written to them. Well. Also you, you&rsquo;re reading it. Hi! But mostly to them, and anyone else who might at some point want to try to publish a TTRPG supplement.</p>
<p>What I&rsquo;d like to do is go through each of the projects I&rsquo;ve decided to back in the <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/discover/advanced?ref=section-zinequest-projectcollection-tag-newest&amp;sort=newest&amp;tag_id=346">2024 ZineQuest</a> and explain why, exactly, it caught my eye. Plus a couple I decided not to back but want to promote. I won&rsquo;t be punching down and talking about anything I decided not to back. That&rsquo;s feedback that might be useful to those specific creators if they ever asked for it, but I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s generally helpful to publish as a list.</p>
<h3 id="first-a-rubric">First, A Rubric</h3>
<p>Essentially I&rsquo;m asking myself three questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Do I think I would ever play it? (Medium-likely.)</li>
<li>Do I think I could convince my friends to play it? (Almost impossible.)</li>
<li>Do I think I could pilfer it for ideas or mechanics? (Most common outcome.)</li>
</ul>
<p>Sometimes there&rsquo;s a few extra points tossed in for &ldquo;I think this idea is really cool and I want it to exist in the world,&rdquo; but you can&rsquo;t optimize for <em>je ne sais quoi</em>.</p>
<h2 id="things-im-backing">Things I&rsquo;m Backing</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/wythe/blister-critters">Blister Critters</a> &ndash; I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ll ever convince my friends to play this, but the art and idea are unique, the presentation is outstanding, and it&rsquo;s entirely unlike the canon of TTRPGs I already own. This is the game I expect people to be copying in ZineQuest 2025.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/robinfjarem/shadow-over-gloomshire">Shadow over Gloomshire</a> &ndash; Five words in the project description were all it took: &ldquo;dark fantasy and gothic horror.&rdquo; This falls into the category of things I&rsquo;m not sure will be directly useful to me, but I want more of it to exist in the world.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/mikelorette/the-lair-of-the-skateomancer">The Lair of the Skateomancer</a> &ndash; I really want to see how the skateboard is implemented as a magic item, and I&rsquo;m interested in the skatepark themed lair. It seems just ridiculous enough to work.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/rightafterthen/radish-quest">Radish Quest</a> &ndash; The art is half of what sold me. Half of the remaining half is that I&rsquo;ve backed another project from this creator before and been happy with it. The remaining half-half is the all-in dedication to the bit in the project description. Radishes.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/moonmax/the-wigmakers-fingers">The Wigmaker&rsquo;s Fingers</a> &ndash; A heist where you steal a prosthetic finger. Everything about the way this is packaged makes me want to know more, and the samples of the layout on the book look great.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/ravensridge/cartograph-atlas-edition-a-solo-mapmaking-ttrpg">Cartograph - Atlas Edition: A Mapmaking TTRPG</a> &ndash; I&rsquo;m interested in the mechanics. Like many TTRPG nerds I someday wish to publish my own world as a supplement, and I&rsquo;m usually interested in systems that I think could help me develop that world.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/residentbard/i-crave-the-loop">I Crave The Loop</a> &ndash; Curious to see how the mechanics work, plus the name and idea are clever.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/crum/details">The Details of Our Escape</a> &ndash; Mostly I want to see how the domino mechanic works, but the art also looks compelling.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/sleepysasquatch/courier-repacked">Courier - Repacked</a> &ndash; The description reads a lot more like a solo board game than a TTRPG to me, so I&rsquo;m curious to see what that&rsquo;s about. It also claims to touch on some interesting ideas, like building a base, and I want to see how that&rsquo;s implemented. I&rsquo;ve always liked the idea of the players being able to make a home, but I find a lot of the mechanics for doing that in traditional TTRPGs to lack depth or interest.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/4randompixels/valheks-guide-to-treasure-hunting">Valhek&rsquo;s Guide to Treasure Hunting</a> &ndash; At $3 the PDF falls squarely into &ldquo;why not&rdquo; territory. It only needs to have one interesting monster or magic item to feel like I&rsquo;ve probably got my money&rsquo;s worth.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/bclev/8-bit-theater-the-roleplaying-game">8-BIT THEATER THE ROLEPLAYING GAME</a> &ndash; Many hundreds of years ago I was an avid reader of 8-Bit Theater. Honestly I&rsquo;m just glad Brian Clevenger is still out there, doing his thing. This is somewhat me just kicking some money to a creator who brought me a lot of joy a very long time ago. It mostly doesn&rsquo;t matter if the product is any good. But it looks like it probably will be, if nothing else, pretty funny.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/hungryfamiliar/bookwyrm-loot-some-books">Bookwyrm: Loot some books!</a> &ndash; Much like Valhek&rsquo;s Guide, the $4 entry price for a PDF of random tables is enough to get it a &ldquo;why not.&rdquo; The concept is cute, and I could probably make use of it in a campaign somewhere.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/scottwegener/cult-of-the-morach-an-old-school-adventure">Cult of the Morach: An Old School Adventure</a> &ndash; Mostly interested to see how the encounter clocks function. That&rsquo;s something I&rsquo;ve done before, and I think it can be a useful way to pace events that happen whether or not the players are paying attention. I&rsquo;m curious to see if there&rsquo;s a better way to do it. The adventure itself looks like it could also be interesting, but it&rsquo;s for a system I don&rsquo;t play, so it&rsquo;s probably going to serve as inspiration and not be something I ever use directly.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/eryksawicki/milk-bar-sci-fi-osr-roleplaying-in-post-communist-poland">Milk Bar: sci-fi roleplaying in post-Soviet Poland</a> &ndash; Once again looking at the base building mechanics, although the setting is also wholly new to me. I didn&rsquo;t know what a Milk Bar was before. The physical edition and layout also looks fantastic.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/dimdayred/dimday-red-ttrpg-nodus-02">Dimday Red TTRPG - Nodus Zine 02</a> &ndash; I backed the original Dimday Red kickstarter in ZineQuest 2023, and I think the world is an interesting one. Mid-apocalyptic catches me in much the same way post-apocalyptic would, but it&rsquo;s a relatively unique take. Stories rarely linger in the middle of the world ending.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/bodieh/mystery-under-magi-mart">Mystery Under Magi-Mart</a> &ndash; I think this might be a fun thing to run as a Line Entertainment [E]nforcer at PAX.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/brookletgames/beetle-knight">Beetle Knight</a> &ndash; You can be a moth.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/johnsonofair/the-tower-a-puzzle-dungeon-crawl">The Tower - A System Agnostic Puzzle Dungeon Crawl</a> &ndash; This hits a few highlights. It&rsquo;s a puzzle/riddle dungeon and it&rsquo;s system agnostic. The kind of thing I&rsquo;m likely to be able to slip into any campaign where it might be useful. Too many supplements want to give me more monsters, but I don&rsquo;t really need more monsters. I have too many already. A good puzzle that players might enjoy solving is hard to come by.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/dngnclub/dngn-club-relics-remastered-vol-1">DNGN CLUB: Relics Remastered Vol. 1</a> &ndash; A kitchen sink of the author&rsquo;s best ideas. Some of the samples are evocative. I&rsquo;m curious to see what can be pilfered.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/9thlevel/sentai-and-sensibility">Sentai &amp; Sensibility RPG</a> &ndash; If you have never wanted to be simultaneously both the green Power Ranger and also Mr Darcy, then I&rsquo;m not entirely certain that we can relate. But if you have, now is your chance.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/gametee/thrifty-trades-of-fey-zine-quest">Thrifty Trades of Fey</a> &ndash; I&rsquo;ve backed just about everything <a href="https://gametee.co.uk/">Gametee</a> have ever made and been delighted by all of it. What particularly caught my eye is the use of an origami fortune teller. I want to see how they make use of it as a mechanic.</p>
<h2 id="things-im-not-backing">Things I&rsquo;m Not Backing</h2>
<p>These are projects that I&rsquo;m not getting for one reason or another, but I think they&rsquo;re cool and maybe you&rsquo;ll be interested.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/aethercorp/field-agent-handbook">Field Agent Handbooks: Observancy Dept. 1924–28</a> &ndash; This is a cool idea, but I know to my teeth that I&rsquo;d never make any use of it. The idea doesn&rsquo;t seem to be pilferable. For the right person this would probably be a lot of fun, I&rsquo;m just not that person.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/josiahmoore/tiny-fables">Tiny Fables</a> &ndash; The art on this is gorgeous, but it&rsquo;s for a system I don&rsquo;t play and don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ll pick up. The examples make it seem like it would be difficult to adapt any of it to the games I do play.</p>

			 <p>Back at home safely ensconced in my office, wearing <a href="https://www.theslanket.com/">the slanket</a>, and it&rsquo;s time to talk about Hawaii. This is going to be something of a journal post, while also exploring some thought processes out loud. Apologies in advance if that&rsquo;s not your thing!</p>
<h3 id="how-did-you-end-up-going-to-hawaii-anyway">How Did You End Up Going to Hawaii Anyway?</h3>
<p>Medium story short, it was originally a work trip. Having never been to Hawaii, or indeed to any &ldquo;tropical&rdquo; or &ldquo;island&rdquo; destination, I tacked on a short mini-vacation the weekend before the work portion. Then the work part got cancelled, and my &ldquo;mini&rdquo; vacation was non-refundable. So, okay. I guess I&rsquo;m going on a short trip to Hawaii. No plans, no friends. Just me and the island.</p>
<h3 id="day-1---wednesday">Day 1 - Wednesday</h3>
<p>I like going places, don&rsquo;t mind flying, but hate airports. The American airport experience is designed to maximize suffering at every touchpoint. With an 8-hour direct flight basically all of Wednesday was dedicated to the trip. Here I want to shout out to American Airlines' premium economy, which made the experience significantly more comfortable. I&rsquo;d say it&rsquo;s roughly equivalent to Alaska Airlines' first class. The seats alone are worth the price of admission.</p>
<p>When I stepped off the airplane, however, I felt the first moist slap of Hawaiian air and&hellip; Well. Have you ever heard of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_syndrome">Paris syndrome</a>? The short version is that Paris is nothing at all like how it&rsquo;s presented in the movies, and when some people experience it &ldquo;in the flesh&rdquo; for the first time the delta between expectation and reality leads to a bunch of negative symptoms.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t say it was exactly like that, but expectation definitely didn&rsquo;t match reality. I can&rsquo;t explain why it never occurred to me that Hawaii would be hot and humid, but it&rsquo;s not what I was prepared for. Mentally, physically, emotionally, financially. In retrospect the fact that I even wore a hoodie now strikes me as hilariously unprepared. But also I didn&rsquo;t even bring a pair of shorts.</p>
<p>So I caught a Lyft to my hotel in Waikiki, turned the air conditioning as low as it could possibly go, and ordered <a href="https://www.hawaiianbarbecue.com/">L&amp;L</a> on a delivery app. Wednesday was a write-off. I was asleep no later than 8pm Hawaiian time, though I think it may have been much closer to 6:30.</p>
<h3 id="day-2---thursday">Day 2 - Thursday</h3>
<p>I woke up at 6am local time on this and every other day of my trip. No alarm. Apparently that&rsquo;s just when my body has decided it&rsquo;s time to get up these days. Side note to myself I wonder if there&rsquo;s something useful I could do with that information WRT my work schedule? Something to think about.</p>
<p>Breakfast at the hotel. Perfectly acceptable. Usual hotel price gouging for usual hotel quality. Then I set off to explore. I decided to head East first because Maps showed a nearby Point of Interest, the Stones of Life.</p>

<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Continuing in that direction for a mile I saw most of the sandy parts of Waikiki, a couple really nice parks, and some chickens. Getting away from the hustle and bustle of &ldquo;the strip&rdquo; was nice, but I drenched my shirt through with sweat due to the humidity. On my way back I stopped at the ABC Store and picked up some coconut water before spending the majority of the day in my hotel room to enjoy the air conditioning and a book.</p>
<p>Dinner was a tour of spam musubi from just about every place I could think of to get one. L&amp;L remains the gold standard as far as I&rsquo;m concerned.</p>
<h3 id="day-3---friday">Day 3 - Friday</h3>
<p>Once again up at 6am I decided to strike out West and see the other half of Waikiki, including a tour of the Royal Hawaiian mall. I found a local malasada place and brought them back to my hotel&rsquo;s (not yet open) beach bar, where they were greatly enjoyed. I watched a series of three catamarans beach themselves, which was shocking and unexpected the first time but which I now gather is a fairly common way of parking there. Still wild to see a 30' boat ram itself into the beach at what feels like much too high a velocity.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Heading back from malasadas I picked up the local transit card, something I do most places I visit, and I made use of that for the afternoon by heading to a local hobby shop. Pretty much everywhere I go, if there&rsquo;s time, I&rsquo;ll hit up the local hobby shops. Sometimes there&rsquo;s interesting things there. Nothing grabbed my attention this time, but the trip back went by <a href="https://www.iolanipalace.org/">Iolani Palace</a> so I hopped off the bus and took a look around. The only way to go in was a paid audio tour, so I didn&rsquo;t. I love to wander at my own discretion but mostly don&rsquo;t enjoy being lead around. The grounds were still spectacular.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<hr>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I think this might have been the night I had the fish sandwich for dinner at the hotel&rsquo;s beach bar. The fish itself was great, but every other decision the chef made was questionable. This is a theme that would repeat both times I ate a meal at the beach bar. The virgin riptide, essentially a minty pina colada, was amazing.</p>
<h3 id="day-4---saturday">Day 4 - Saturday</h3>
<p>Up and out and on the bus, I decided to visit <a href="https://byodo-in.com/">Byodo-In Temple</a> which remains the highlight of the trip. Somewhere in the multiverse there&rsquo;s the version of me who figured out young enough that it was possible to just&hellip; Go become a monk. Probably that version of me is the best version of me. The only thing I did not love about my time at Byodo-In was the behavior of other tourists. Be respectful.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Back on the bus and off to the island&rsquo;s other hobby shop. They didn&rsquo;t have anything I&rsquo;d be interested in, but I&rsquo;m always glad to see small businesses making their dream work. And they recommended a local Thai restaurant on the windward side of the island that had the best panang curry I&rsquo;ve ever eaten, which was also the best thing I had on the entire trip.</p>
<p>In for a penny in for a pound I caught the bus again and rode it all the way around the northern tip of the island, a 2.5 hour trip that left me in <a href="https://www.gohawaii.com/islands/oahu/regions/north-shore">North Shore</a> around mid-afternoon. The whole town has surf bum and artsy jewelry aunt vibes. I grabbed my first and only <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawaiian_shave_ice">shave ice</a> of the trip at <a href="https://matsumotoshaveice.com/">Matsumoto&rsquo;s</a> and would recommend everything about the experience to anyone stuck on Oahu and looking for a place to go.</p>
<p>The bus trip back was another 2.5 hours, this time across the center of the island. In total I spent about 6 hours on the bus on Saturday, for a total daily cost of about $7.50. Not bad when you otherwise have nowhere else to be and all the time in the world to get there.</p>
<p>Dinner was a sushi roll and a big plate of fruit from the ABC store.</p>
<h3 id="day-5---sunday">Day 5 - Sunday</h3>
<p>My last day on the Island, I walked back to the malasada place to get another, and spent my day idling around the hotel. In my room as late as I could, and then on the veranda.</p>
<p>The flight back home was to be a redeye. I&rsquo;ve only ever been forced into an overnight flight two or three times in my life, each of them miserable, and this was no exception. I can&rsquo;t sleep on my back, which means I can&rsquo;t sleep. Earplugs, eye mask, pajama pants. I did everything I could think of to try to improve the experience, but there&rsquo;s no getting around how miserable it was.</p>
<p>Landed at home around 6am Monday morning (today!) drove the hour and a half back from the airport, and then crashed and slept late into the afternoon.</p>
<h3 id="final-thoughts">Final Thoughts</h3>
<p>So was it worth it?</p>
<p>No. Absolutely not. I went lots of places, did lots of things, because that&rsquo;s a better use of my time than being mopey about it, but make no mistake. <a href="https://thewizardly.com/2024/02/01/im-about-to.html">My initial thoughts about Hawaii</a> still hold. I don&rsquo;t understand the person who willingly goes there, we&rsquo;re optimizing for very different things in our life.</p>
<p>I hope to spend the rest of my life at latitudes greater than 35°. North or South. I&rsquo;ll suffer through a long flight if New Zealand awaits me at the end. But the tropics aren&rsquo;t for me, and I hope never to be back.</p>

			 <p>I’m about to say something you might find shocking, so before I do I want to make two things clear:</p>
<ul>
<li>This isn’t a complaint post. The purpose is not to vent.</li>
<li>I actually consider this a positive and optimistic thought process.</li>
</ul>
<p>Okay. Ready?</p>
<h2 id="i-dont-like-hawaii">I don’t like Hawaii</h2>
<p>I’ll wait a moment for the outrage to subside.</p>
<p>Nothing at all against the residents or people. I’ve traveled a lot and my experience is that people, broadly, are kind and welcoming.</p>
<p>I’m here, right now, as I type this, having breakfast under an umbrella in Waikiki, and I have realized that this place is my definition of hell on earth.</p>
<p>And here’s the kicker, I think that’s a good thing. I’ve never been more happy to be unhappy! So I thought it would be worth unpacking what’s up.</p>
<h2 id="travel-preferences">Travel Preferences</h2>
<p>I’m a creature of the cold climates. I originated in the Pacific Northwest, and I crave nothing so much as a cool drizzle in a quiet forest.</p>
<p>January should be the depths of winter in Hawaii. It’s presumably as cold as it gets around here. To my tastes it’s too warm. Not just too warm, but simultaneously too humid. I’ve been in a place that is both warm and humid enough times to realize that I always find this experience miserable.</p>
<ul>
<li>If it’s going to be hot, I want it to be dry.</li>
<li>If it’s going to be wet, I want it to be cold.</li>
<li>If it’s going to be hot and wet, I want it to be Disney world.</li>
</ul>
<p>I’m willing to tolerate the climate for Disney. It’s an exception that proves the rule.</p>
<p>I’ve realized something I probably should have figured out a long time ago. My idea of paradise isn’t a tropical island with a fruity drink, it isn’t sand, it isn’t the ocean.</p>
<p>Paradise is a cabin in the woods, plush rugs, a roaring fire, and snow outside the window. It’s Estes Park, CO in February. It’s Walden Pond.</p>
<p>I’m having a miserable time, but I’m actually happy about it, because now I know something important about myself. And now I’m excited for all the trips I can plan with that knowledge in mind.</p>

			 <p>I finished <a href="">Roots of Pacha</a> at a little over 50 hours of total play time. I still wouldn&rsquo;t recommend it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But random internet wizard, what would you recommend?&rdquo; I hear you cry.</p>
<h1 id="contrariwises-definitive-and-not-at-all-biased-guide-to-cozy-sim-games">Contrariwise&rsquo;s Definitive and Not At All Biased Guide to Cozy Sim Games</h1>
<h2 id="not-sweaty">Not Sweaty</h2>
<h3 id="1-stardew-valleyhttpsstoresteampoweredcomapp413150stardew_valley">1) <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/413150/Stardew_Valley/">Stardew Valley</a></h3>
<p>I&rsquo;ve played Stardew all the way through to completion twice. I&rsquo;ll probably play it again someday. Many of its best ideas are now fully dispersed into the cozy sim game ecosystem, but few games really do it as thoroughly and as well. I have basically two notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Stop trying to make fishing mini games. They don&rsquo;t work. I would be tempted to say nobody likes these, because nobody I&rsquo;ve met likes them, but everything is somebody&rsquo;s thing so I&rsquo;m certain that somebody out there lives for the incredibly bland experience of staring at a screen waiting for a pixel to change. Seriously. Stop it.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;m not really a fan of the relationship mechanic where you have to go talk to everyone once a day, or remember when characters' birthdays are, or remember what their favorite gifts are. I&rsquo;m less critical of this one than fishing, because I fully admit this is just my preference whereas I think fishing minigames are a true blight that should be stricken from the catalogue of game mechanics.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-graveyard-keeperhttpsstoresteampoweredcomapp599140graveyard_keeper">2) <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/599140/Graveyard_Keeper/">Graveyard Keeper</a></h3>
<p>This is by far my favorite cozy sim game. I love the macabre setting, I love the mechanics. You don&rsquo;t spend nearly as much time keeping the namesake graveyard as the title might lead you to believe, and I think that&rsquo;s the source of some of its less favorable reviews, but if you&rsquo;re willing to set that aside the mechanical process of playing the game is a delight. My one complaint is that the UI/UX are a bit cumbersome playing on a controller, but that&rsquo;s it. Otherwise 10/10, perfect game.</p>
<h3 id="3-animal-crossinghttpsanimalcrossingnintendocom">3) <a href="https://animalcrossing.nintendo.com/">Animal Crossing</a></h3>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard to know what to even say about Animal Crossing. I feel like if somehow you don&rsquo;t already know this game is for you it probably isn&rsquo;t. It&rsquo;s at its most fun if everyone you know is also playing, so there&rsquo;s a huge incentive to get the new game when it first comes out and play it with your friends. The long tail of being the only person you know still playing Animal Crossing doesn&rsquo;t pass the vibe check. If you haven&rsquo;t played New Horizons yet, now isn&rsquo;t the time to start, but keep an eye out for announcements of a new version and hop on the bandwagon early for maximum enjoyment. Minor quibbles include:</p>
<ul>
<li>I wish they would focus on fewer, higher quality interactions with villagers. Having 100+ possible shades of animal person that only share 16 possible sets of dialogue doesn&rsquo;t do much for me.</li>
<li>New Horizons was needlessly punishing about the rarity of some furniture spawns. I got bored and gave up before collecting some of the sets I wanted for various rooms. There&rsquo;s only so many days I&rsquo;m willing to launch a game and not see any new content. I realize there&rsquo;s a limit on the total amount of content they could ever include, but there are sets I know for a fact existed in the game where no piece ever dropped for me, while I had seen 5+ repeats on the ones that did.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="slightly-sweaty">Slightly Sweaty</h2>
<h3 id="1-valheimhttpsstoresteampoweredcomapp892970valheim">1) <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/892970/Valheim/">Valheim</a></h3>
<p>On the face of it, Valheim is a game I wouldn&rsquo;t expect to enjoy. And if I had played it solo, I probably wouldn&rsquo;t have. However, in concert with someone who actually enjoyed the combat mechanics where I was mostly free to tend my garden and organize storage chests I had a lot of fun. This could be a good game for you if you either don&rsquo;t mind the combat parts or can get someone else to do them.</p>
<h3 id="2-minecrafthttpswwwminecraftnet">2) <a href="https://www.minecraft.net">Minecraft</a></h3>
<p>For what it&rsquo;s worth, I prefer modded Minecraft. It&rsquo;s at its best as a playground for ideas and mechanics that aren&rsquo;t quite enough to be a game on their own. I haven&rsquo;t played since probably 1.12, and I think they&rsquo;ve made the combat sweatier in ways I would not enjoy, so this has fallen in my ranking to near the bottom of things I might recommend. Ask me a decade ago and it likely would have been the top. It&rsquo;s hard to recommend a specific modpack, because they change frequently and I&rsquo;m now several years out from having looked, but the place I&rsquo;d start today would be to see if <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/direwolf20">Direwolf20</a> is still kicking around. Whatever he&rsquo;s playing.</p>
<h1 id="games-that-sometimes-people-think-i-would-like-but-i-dont-because-theyre-too-sweaty">Games That Sometimes People Think I would Like But I Don&rsquo;t Because They&rsquo;re Too Sweaty</h1>
<h3 id="1-terrariahttpsstoresteampoweredcomapp105600terraria">1) <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/105600/Terraria/">Terraria</a></h3>
<p>It&rsquo;s not for me. I&rsquo;ve tried maybe 2-3 times, and I don&rsquo;t enjoy the mechanics. I also think it&rsquo;s sweaty. Terraria is Minecraft for people that want harder combat and more things to kill. No shade if this is your game, but it&rsquo;s not mine.</p>
<h3 id="2-starboundhttpsstoresteampoweredcomapp211820starbound">2) <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/211820/Starbound/">Starbound</a></h3>
<p>This is Terraria in space. I don&rsquo;t like it for all the same reasons, despite the fact that it&rsquo;s in space. I usually like space, but space won&rsquo;t save a game I don&rsquo;t otherwise enjoy.</p>
<hr>
<p>That&rsquo;s it. That&rsquo;s the list. There are other sim games out there, cozy or otherwise, but I don&rsquo;t feel the need to comment. Possibly I haven&rsquo;t had the chance to play them. Possibly I know I wouldn&rsquo;t like them for some of the reasons I&rsquo;ve already attributed above.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not really looking for recommendations for games at this time, I barely have any time to play them and I&rsquo;ve committed to not buying anything new until the backlog is clear, but hopefully this helps someone figure out what to play next. Or at least what not to play next.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;ve been away from home the last two weeks, give or take, smushing some personal travel together with some business travel to minimize my &ldquo;suffering per airport hour&rdquo; statistic as much as possible. If work&rsquo;s going to pay for me to go somewhere, I&rsquo;m going to try and get a mini-vacation out of it. I&rsquo;m home for what feels like seven seconds, before heading back out on another mini-vaction-turned-actual-vacation next week.</p>
<p>What started out as the pre-vacation of a work trip became a vacation-vacation when the work portion of the trip got cancelled but my hotel was non-refundable. So now I&rsquo;m going to Hawaii, and I know this is going to sound like crazy talk from someone who barely manages to sound sane most of the time, but in a perfect world I wish I weren&rsquo;t. It&rsquo;s a long flight for a relatively short stay in the fanciest and most expensive hotel I&rsquo;ve ever personally booked on my own dime.</p>
<p>At least it&rsquo;s all pre-paid.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m planning to use it as a chance to relax on a beach, like I&rsquo;ve always said I wanted to, combined with my first quarter check-in / personal retreat. I&rsquo;ll be barely just one month into the <a href="https://thewizardly.com/2023/12/31/its-the-last.html">Year of Scales and Arpeggios</a>, so I&rsquo;m not entirely certain what a check-in will look like. But hey. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwux9KiBMjE">Beach</a>.</p>
<h2 id="other-updates">Other Updates</h2>
<ul>
<li>I finished <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1868140/DAVE_THE_DIVER/">DAVE THE DIVER</a>. Once I turned on the accessibility setting that removed frantic button tapping, I found it a lot more approachable. I hope this trend of accessibility settings to turn off the parts of games I find obnoxious continues.</li>
<li>I started playing <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1245560/Roots_of_Pacha/">Roots of Pacha</a>. This is the most time I&rsquo;ve ever spent on a game that I wouldn&rsquo;t recommend. It&rsquo;s a prehistoric Stardew clone, and while it has some interesting ideas I think it fails to execute on the best of them while retaining the parts I like least from the overall genre. I tried to refund it after my first hour of playing and was denied because I had owned it for too many weeks. If I could go back, I&rsquo;d still get it refunded. Nevertheless I&rsquo;ve somehow managed to spend almost 40 hours on it? A lot of that time I think was me waiting to see if it would pay off on its premise, and I&rsquo;m now deep enough to say that no it doesn&rsquo;t but I might as well see my investment through to the end of its story.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;m also back on <a href="https://www.fallenlondon.com/">Fallen London</a>, which is great. If you, too, would like to be stolen by bats, I&rsquo;m looking for friends to infest with rats.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;m currently watching <a href="https://thetvdb.com/series/tales-from-the-crypt">Tales from the Crypt</a> for the first time as an adult. It almost entirely stands up all these years later, and I would put it in the pantheon of one of the best shows ever made.</li>
<li>Somehow someone let me sign up to be a Librarian for <a href="https://hardcover.app/">Hardcover</a> which mostly entails updating the details of books. I don&rsquo;t anticipate this being a major ongoing commitment, but I&rsquo;m detail-oriented and plan to at the very least update the books that I&rsquo;m personally reading and tracking. If you&rsquo;re looking to not be on Goodreads anymore, the app and community and vibe are all excellent.</li>

			 <p>As part of the Year of Scales and Arpeggios I find myself needing to keep track of new things in new ways. The problem is that tracking things, like naming them, is hard. Maybe it&rsquo;s less hard for people that don&rsquo;t suffer from perfectionism. It&rsquo;s hard for me. The ideal system is one which tracks itself, but those are few and far between and rarely support the other principles that matter to me.</p>
<p>One of the things I want to improve on is how much time I spend on my hobbies. To be clear: it&rsquo;s currently not enough. I would like to spend more time on my hobbies. But I&rsquo;ve got a lot of other things competing for my time, and that means left to my own devices I won&rsquo;t naturally spend more time working on the things that I want to work on. So I&rsquo;m tracking it. Currently the form of that tracking is a daily tick box in my 2024 Hobonichi Techo Cousin. Pro: it&rsquo;s flexible to my needs. Con: it&rsquo;s hard to remember to look in the planner.</p>
<p>I suppose I could talk about planners in general, the problem being that I absolutely adore the tactile feel of paper, but I don&rsquo;t find it very useful to try to manage my mostly-digital life with mostly-analog tools. There&rsquo;s occasionally value in enforcing the gap, and I think that I think better &ldquo;on paper,&rdquo; but I know that trying to move my calendar or todo list to paper would be foolhardy at best and catastrophic at worst.</p>
<p>So, better or worse, I&rsquo;ve got a paper planner that I mostly don&rsquo;t use for traditional planning. But it gives me room to explore the space. Maybe these checkboxes are the path forward, maybe they&rsquo;re not, but they&rsquo;re much easier to change if I figure out something better than if I doubled-down on an app-based solution that would only ever work &ldquo;how it works,&rdquo; and likely require me to test 3-5 different apps to find the one that worked the way I needed it to. In my experience, apps are rarely a solution to any problems. They are frequently the problem I&rsquo;m attempting to solve.</p>
<p>Last week&rsquo;s boxes were:</p>
<ul>
<li>Up by 8</li>
<li>Morning planning</li>
<li>Apple rings</li>
<li>40K</li>
<li>Reading</li>
<li>Sleep</li>
</ul>
<p>I&rsquo;ve already reworked that to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Awake on time</li>
<li>30 minute walk</li>
<li>Hobby</li>
<li>Reading</li>
<li>Asleep on time</li>
</ul>
<p>Most days I want to be up by 8, but not all, so generalizing the check makes it easier to set up my planner each week. A checkmark for whether or not I closed all my apple rings is somewhat redundant, since I can look that up at any time. Much more useful is to track whether I engaged in the behaviors that lead to the desired result. &ldquo;Hobby&rdquo; remains to be seen if it meets the need. The main hobby I want to do more of is Warhammer 40K, but it&rsquo;s not my only hobby and there are nights where I have commitments or obligations that consume the time I might otherwise spend. I suspect that one will change again, even though I don&rsquo;t yet know how I&rsquo;d change it.</p>
<p>Reading deserves a special call-out. Arguably, it&rsquo;s a hobby, but it&rsquo;s one I&rsquo;ve struggled to maintain to my own satisfaction for nearly 20 years. In high school I was voracious, not least of which because I was often ignoring the teachers. I wish I had something approximating Goodreads data for how many books I used to read, but subjectively I&rsquo;d estimate a 2x-3x over my best year as an adult. I&rsquo;ve had the best luck setting aside time before bed to read, so that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ve done again, and that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m tracking. And then, to make sure I don&rsquo;t accidentally forget to sleep because &ldquo;just one more chapter,&rdquo; I track that I lay down to sleep on time. Midnight, for the curious.</p>
<p>I like that paper gives me the freedom to try to figure out the best way to track this. And it&rsquo;s a physical object in the world that&rsquo;s harder to accidentally forget to update. Most importantly it&rsquo;s a place to start. Starting is often the hardest part.</p>

			 <p>It&rsquo;s the last day of the <strong>Year of Time</strong>, and I think of it broadly as a success. I&rsquo;ve cut my commitments to the bare minimum, and for the first time in forever have been making solid progress on self care and relaxation as a goal. Most nights, after work, there hasn&rsquo;t been more work.</p>
<p>The Steam Deck has been life changing, being a system perfect for the playing of games and almost nothing else. My computers have always been full of too many non-gaming temptations to be effective gaming machines, even when they were very much built with that express purpose in mind.</p>
<p>Now I notice all the little places where previously robust systems have been allowed to atrophy. I don&rsquo;t cook my own meals as often, I don&rsquo;t get out for as many walks, books remain un-read, hobbies find themselves un-pursued. Foundations need to be relaid. It&rsquo;s time to build again.</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s next?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say you were going to learn to play the piano this year. If you learn to play from a teacher, you&rsquo;ll likely follow a fairly familiar pattern: learn the structure of the instrument, the names of the keys, the location of middle C. Then the structure of a chord, how certain keys played together relate to each other. You&rsquo;d learn to play a few songs you hadn&rsquo;t thought of since grade school.</p>
<p>And then you&rsquo;d reach the point that breaks most people: you&rsquo;d learn your scales and arpeggios.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;d play the same series of notes over, and over, and over, moving up the scale, then down the scale, then up and down the scale, then up and down the next scale starting a single key higher. It would not sound like music. It would sound like the scene in every movie where the child is learning piano and the parent is out of their mind with the monotony of the same notes over and over and over.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s awful, and you&rsquo;d likely hate it. Most people do. But here&rsquo;s the thing: it&rsquo;s critically important. The repeated routine of the mundane is what gets you to excellence. All the while your fingers are repeating those same notes they&rsquo;re building familiarity with how to move between the keys, what it feels like. Muscles and memory are strengthening together. You&rsquo;re creating the conditions that will someday allow you to fly, but for today you must walk. And walk. And walk.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never met anyone that enjoys the process of playing scales and arpeggios, but the end result is Beethoven. Mozart. Chopin. Through the regular and routine practice of the basics, comes mastery.</p>
<h1 id="the-year-of-scales-and-arpeggios">The Year of Scales and Arpeggios</h1>
<p>My theme for 2024 is to develop mastery of the mundane. To build the foundations and implement the systems that look like walking today, none of which are flashy or fun, that I believe will allow me to someday fly. It&rsquo;s time to focus on the beautiful execution of the basic and the boring.</p>
<p>What does that look like in practice? Here&rsquo;s a few of the things I&rsquo;m thinking about currently.</p>
<ul>
<li>Options require decisions, decisions create opportunity cost. Remove options everywhere I can. Build and follow routines for anything important.</li>
<li>If it&rsquo;s worth doing, it&rsquo;s worth doing every day. 15 minutes a day adds up to a little more than 80 hours a year, or two standard American work weeks. I can get a lot done in 80 hours if I try.</li>
<li>The simple thing I can actually do reliably will always beat the complicated thing that works occasionally, or for limited duration.</li>
</ul>
<p>And here&rsquo;s a few of my tentative plans for the new year:</p>
<ul>
<li>Wake up at least an hour before work starts, use 30 minutes of that time to walk on my treadmill while also doing daily planning. Stealing that idea almost entirely from CGP Grey, but it seems like a good one.</li>
<li>Systematize meal planning. I&rsquo;d like to create a series of week-long &ldquo;menus&rdquo; that can be rotated, where what we need to buy and what we&rsquo;re going to eat on any given night are already planned from the meals I know we like. The weekend is a great chance to experiment with new things, because I enjoy cooking, but I don&rsquo;t really want to be trying new things on a busy weeknight.</li>
<li>Get real serious about the least serious sport. It&rsquo;s time to really learn to play disc golf.</li>
</ul>

			 <p>A couple days belated, but last week was primarily about the run-up to Christmas. My routine for the last several weeks has been to wrap up dinner then settle on the couch with my Steam Deck, play something, and have a movie on in the background. I think as a result I&rsquo;ve seen more movies in December than the preceding decade.</p>
<p>In alphabetical order:</p>
<ul>
<li>8-Bit Christmas (2021)</li>
<li>A Christmas Story (1983)</li>
<li>Emmet Otter&rsquo;s Jug-Band Christmas (1977)</li>
<li>Frosty the Snowman (1969)</li>
<li>Groundhog Day (1993)</li>
<li>Home Alone (1990)</li>
<li>How the Grinch Stole Christmas (2000)</li>
<li>Klaus (2019)</li>
<li>The Muppet Christmas Carol (1992)</li>
<li>Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer (1964)</li>
<li>The Santa Clause (1994)</li>
<li>Scrooged (1988)</li>
<li>Silent Night, Deadly Night (1984)</li>
<li>Silent Night, Deadly Night Part 2 (1987)</li>
<li>A Very Murray Christmas (2015)</li>
<li>White Christmas (1954)</li>
</ul>
<p>I have thoughts about most of them, but I think I can summarize and say that the only one I for sure wouldn&rsquo;t watch a second time is the original Silent Night, Deadly Night, and that&rsquo;s because the first 30-45 minutes of Part 2 are a direct re-telling of the original. That was a fun back-to-back watch one night.</p>
<p>The other thing I noticed is that Rudolph has some interesting and unintended cultural commentary. It&rsquo;s a film that I don&rsquo;t think would get made today, and not just because it&rsquo;s claymation. The premise that someone should be ostracized because of a small physical difference that has no bearing at all on their abilities basically doesn&rsquo;t play in our society anymore, for good reason. That this was ever considered &ldquo;acceptable,&rdquo; I think, explains a lot about my parents' generation. But I&rsquo;ll always stan the island of misfit toys.</p>
<p>While watching all these movies I mostly played Dave the Diver, which I would give something in the neighborhood of 80%. It&rsquo;s basically a series of minigames wrapped in a roguelike. Which are all words that generally would not recommend a game to me. However, there&rsquo;s a lot of charm, the roguelike parts are mostly not awful and only punishing when you &ldquo;lose,&rdquo; which very quickly becomes easy to not do.</p>
<p>Most of the minigames are only forced on you once, and then become entirely optional for replay. And it&rsquo;s impressive for the sheer breadth of how many different kinds of games they snuck in. In later stages it&rsquo;s variously a Tomagatchi, a business simulator, a rhythm game, and a bullet hell. It&rsquo;s like the developers tossed the entire kitchen sink at it, with enough fidelity that they all feel like honest representations of their genre. I didn&rsquo;t exactly enjoy most of them, because they&rsquo;re not genres I would have wanted to play, but I did enjoy the framing of them in the context of a silly little sushi game, and none of them went on so long or were so difficult that they roadblocked the rest of the experience. Probably the best $20 I&rsquo;ve spent on Steam in 2023.</p>

			 <p>I quietly set the goal of spending no money for a week and almost managed to do it. There’s nearly enough food in the house that if I’m clever I don’t need to supplement much to make a week’s worth of meals. Even though we ended up making a few grocery runs, we avoided eating out so I’m still calling it a success.</p>
<p>Heading into 2024 I’m wondering how long I can extend the concept. A no-buy month? A no-buy <strong>year</strong>? I don’t think I could get much beyond a month without needing a proper grocery run, but how many other things could I get by without buying?</p>
<p>I started winding down my comics hobby, and I’m going to let the ones that I’m already technically in the middle of finish out their runs. It’ll probably the next six months for final issues to land. Probably another six months after that to catch up on the backlog.</p>
<p>Also made some progress on migrating to a new project management system for Warhammer. Since I have a bad habit of putting down half-finished work I need a way to remember what’s done on a model. YouTrack feels like 80% of Jira, but the right 80%. It’s almost suspiciously pleasant to use. I’ve got about 10% of the data entry done, enough to kick the tires and know it probably move the rest over the next couple of weeks.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://thewizardly.com/2023/12/13/an-opinionated-decision-matrix-for/">An Opinionated Decision Matrix for Which TTRPG System to Use</a></h1>

			 <p><strong>If</strong> your primary concern is getting people together at a table to play at all, pick D&amp;D 5E. Everyone knows how to play it, it can be molded to meet the needs of any table, and there are countless off the shelf supplements already available to help a current or aspiring Dungeon Master.</p>
<p>The reality for many people is that it doesn&rsquo;t matter which TTRPG system they use, because the struggle is going to be getting four or more adults together in a room for two or more hours in the first place. Under those conditions, the path of least resistance is the correct path, and that is almost always going to mean D&amp;D 5E. There is nothing wrong with making this choice. It&rsquo;s more important that you have fun with your friends engaging with a hobby you love than just about any other consideration.</p>
<p><strong>If</strong>, on the other hand, your primary concern is literally anything else, then there is always going to be a better system to choose than D&amp;D 5E. The reality is that it doesn&rsquo;t matter how you choose to define &ldquo;better&rdquo; in this case, there&rsquo;s going to be something that rises to the bar. The so-called &ldquo;world&rsquo;s most popular tabletop RPG&rdquo; got there in the same way that Kleenex became the most well-known facial tissue. It is the lowest common denominator. Ubiquitous. Acceptable, though not aspirational. D&amp;D is &ldquo;good enough&rdquo; most of the time. But if you have the time and the inclination, you can do better.</p>
<p>Someone out there has lovingly crafted a TTRPG system perfectly tailored to tell the kind of story you want to tell, and they want nothing more than for you to experience it and find joy. The only limit is the amount of time you can spend trying to find it and whether you can convince your friends to play it.</p>

			 <p>Resisting the urge to wait until I know exactly what I want to say before saying anything.</p>
<p>Spent the day on the couch playing <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1868140/DAVE_THE_DIVER/">Dave the Diver</a> which I did not like at first, but which I think gets better, and watching Christmas movies. It&rsquo;s a rare treat to get to spend a weekend day doing basically nothing, by which I mean doing only what sounds nice in a relaxing manner.</p>
<p>Speaking of Christmas movies, I watched <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CI-YWRK0VPo">8-Bit Christmas</a> for the first time, and it ended up being deeply touching. I cried. I think the premise is maybe a 6/10, but the execution has a lot of heart. If it sounds even remotely like something you might enjoy, it has my stamp of recommendation.</p>
<p>With two weeks left in the Year of Time, I&rsquo;ve got one last cut to make. It&rsquo;s time to say goodbye to comic books. I&rsquo;ve done a terrible job of keeping up with them since I picked the hobby back up in May 2022, and rather than let them slowly continue to pile up in the living room I&rsquo;m going to wind it down so that I can focus more on my keystone hobby goals for 2024. This Tyranid army isn&rsquo;t going to paint itself.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s pretty clear that I still have at least three major time-sink hobbies, and I estimate that I could probably keep up with maybe two of them. One of the following probably needs to go:</p>
<ul>
<li>Warhammer 40K (unlikely)</li>
<li>TTRPGs (unlikely)</li>
<li>Lorcana (&hellip; possibly.)</li>
</ul>
<p>Lorcana doesn&rsquo;t take up that much time at the moment, because in practice I don&rsquo;t actually play it. I&rsquo;m collecting cards on the chance that a future version of me decides it&rsquo;s more fun than the other options currently taking up that time. There exists a future version of me who wishes the current version of me were doing this, and until I&rsquo;m certain I won&rsquo;t become that person it&rsquo;s cheap insurance. But I fully acknowledge I&rsquo;m not actually doing anything with the cards at the moment.</p>
